<p>Please follow the Instructions below to upload documents on Epic:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click  the "More Activities" button on the bottom left of the patient's chart on Epic
<li>Click "Media Manager"
<li>On the new window that opens up, click "Import"
<li>Find the file you would like to upload. You will need to find the file manually (i.e. go to "Computer", then "C:", then to the folder where you stored the file when you uploaded it). The Documents/Pictures/Music folders on the left do not correspond to the same folders on your workstation.
<li>Enter the name of the document, the type of document it is, and who you would like to get a notification that the document has been uploaded (usually the clinic team).
<li>Click the accept button at the very bottom of the screen. You might need to resize your windows a little bit go find it. </ul>
