Addressing this and the need for confidentiality at the beginning of the visit is important. Before asking adults to leave the room, always ask whether they have any concerns to express or questions to ask and assure them of further interaction once the confidential interview is over. Sometimes having a confidential moment with the adult can also be very informative to the patient’s care. Consider starting your HEEADSSS assessment by asking about the patient’s strengths. A simple question such as “What are your greatest strengths” can go a long way in rapport building and eliciting motivations to engage in healthy behavior change. Bold (green) = essential questions Italics (blue) = as time permits Plain text (red) = optional or when the situation requires 3.3.1 Home Where do you live? Who lives w/ you?

Much cheaper w/ Rx. - Safe to call in a prescription w/o pregnancy test or seeing patient Copper IUD (Paragard) - Most effective form of EC (&gt;99%), effective up to 7 days after unprotected sex - Can provide up to 12 years of highly effective contraception after placement Must be placed in a clinic setting by a trained provider For more information on emergency contraception (EC), please see the following resources: Bedsider, reproductiveaccess.org, Mass.gov EC site 3.5.2 Shared Decision Making (SDM) Collaborative process, allows patients and their providers to make healthcare decisions together, taking into account the best scientific evidence available, as well as the patient’s values and preferences Provider role: knowledge of the medical information Patient role: expert regarding their own values and preferences 3.5.3 Applying SDM Principles to Contraceptive Counseling Visits 3.5.3.1 Establish rapport “What brings you in today? What’s happening with your birth control?” “Why did you decide to choose ____?” Ask interactive open-ended questions. The HEEADSSS assessment is a great way to establish rapport for new patients. 3.5.3.2 Assess patient readiness “What are important features that your birth control should have?” “What did you like/dislike about the birth control methods you used in the past?” “Different types of birth control affect your period differently. Some make your period a bit heavier, lighter, sporadic, or may take your period away. Which do you think will be best for you?” 3.5.3.3 Tailor information and discussion to patient preferences/needs Your patient says they want a method where they will still have a regular period. Counsel them on the contraceptive ring, patch, pill, and copper IUD and NOT on the shot, implant, or LNG IUDs. Your patient says they want a method that is easy to keep private. Counsel them on the contraceptive implant, shot, IUD, and ring and NOT on the pill or patch. Your patient has heavy periods and doesn’t want them to be any heavier. Provide information on any method other than the copper IUD. Your patient says they absolutely want to have a period every month. Provide more information on the LNG 15 and 19.5mg IUDs, and Copper IUD, and NOT the LNG 52mg IUD (Mirena). Use patient’s identified preferences for discussing particular methods. Being knowledgeable of contraceptive mechanisms of action, side effects, and delivery routes is important to provide this tailored information. 3.5.3.4 Discuss contraception side effects “Patients who begin the birth control pill may have breast tenderness or a mild headache during the first month. These usually go away.” “With the LNG 52mg IUD, you may have spotting for about 4 months after placement, then your period will become lighter. After a year with the IUD, some patients stop getting their period.” Many patients feel they do not receive adequate information about side effects, and that providers often overlook possible side effects in counseling discussions. It is important to discuss the specific side effects that patients should expect with the contraception type that is aligned with their preferences. 3.5.3.5 Identify misconceptions about specific contraception methods “I’m sorry that your friend had a bad experience with the vaginal contraceptive ring and weight gain. This isn’t typical with most ring users. I support you in using this method because it aligns with your preferences. If you experience weight gain, you can absolutely choose a different option.” “I hear your concern that your friend had worsening acne with her IUD. We usually don’t see this in the majority of patients, so it’s not likely that it will happen to you.” Respectfully addressing myths or misconceptions about IUD types helps to keep conversations open, while providing patients with accurate information. 3.5.3.6 Ensure access to method discontinuation at any time “If you decide you don’t like this birth control, you can switch to something else at any time.” “If you decide that you want to stop your birth control, I’m always here to talk about it and to support you.” “If for whatever reason you decide that you don’t want the IUD anymore, I will remove it.” Patients should be informed at the time of insertion that they can have their IUD removed at any time, and for any reason. IUD removal should be provided with the immediacy as “same-day” IUD placement is provided.

Primary and secondary w/ normal secondary sex characteristics: Urine pregnancy; FSH; Testosterone level; prolactin level – if elevated, need MRI of head to evaluate for prolactinoma; Progestin withdrawal test: Positive response indicates the production of estrogen w/o normal cycling such as in PCOS (if evidence of hyperandrogenism or elevated testosterone). Negative test w/ low FSH suggests low estrogen state as is seen in hypothalamic amenorrhea from nutritional deficiency. Negative test w/ high FSH indicates ovarian insufficiency. 3.12.6 Management PCOS: hormonal contraception or cyclical provera 10mg/day x 10d to induce bleeding Irreversible hypopituitarism or ovarian insufficiency: Premarin 0.625-2.5 mg/day or transdermal estrogen and Provera 10mg/day medroxyprogesterone 10-14 days per month. Hypothalamic amenorrhea related to nutritional deficiency: energy re-balance/weight restoration 3.13 Gender Affirming Care 3.13.1 Why One of our roles as providers of gender diverse youth is to combat the adverse experiences and risk factors for developing mental health disorders by building safe communities for our patients and adopting a gender affirming approach to care. 3.13.2 How Call patients by the name and pronouns that they tell you best describe them in all clinical settings. Build our lexicon to help lead our co-workers by example in using appropriate and non-stigmatizing language to affirm the child’s or adolescent’s authentic self and gender identity (see gender-bread person below for review of terminology). Ask about gender identity at routine healthcare visits. Individuals who identify as transgender have higher rates of depression, anxiety, eating disorders, self-harm, and suicide compared to their cis-gendered peers. Screen for these when the opportunity arises and provide appropriate referrals/supports PRN. 3.13.3 Gender Affirming Care Clinics At BMC: CATCH At BCH: GeMs 3.13.4 The Genderbread Person Genderbread Person 3.14 Eating Disorders (ED) 3.14.1 Anorexia Nervosa (AN) 3.14.1.1 PowerPlans / Order Sets / EBGs Restrictive Eating Power Plan and Admission Orderset Restrictive Eating EBG 3.14.1.2 Definition Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements, leading to a significantly low body weight in the context of age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health Significantly low weight is defined as a weight that is less than minimally normal or, for children and adolescents, less than minimally expected Intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes w/ weight gain, even though at a significantly low weight Disturbance in the way in which one’s body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of the current low body weight 3.14.1.3 Clinical Manifestations Weight loss, abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, cold intolerance, lanugo, fatigue, weakness, delayed puberty 3.14.1.4 Physical Exam Low body temp, bradycardia, low blood pressure, orthostasis, lanugo, dry skin and hair, scalp hair thinning, scaphoid abdomen, palpable stool, breast atrophy, hypoestrogenized vaginal mucosa 3.14.1.5 Evaluation Labs: CBCd, UA, urine pregnancy, chem 10, LFTs, TFTs, and EKG Weight: Compared to prior growth charts; calculate IBW based off of 50% BMI for age (unless previously tracking on different percentile) 3.14.1.6 Inpatient Management Restrictive Eating protocol If 18yo+, then must sign contract in ED agreeing to protocol Goal is to medically stabilize (weight &gt;80% of IBW), VSS (HR &gt;50, no longer orthostatic), electrolytes stable (monitor potassium, phos and mag) Refeed gradually to target meal plan while monitoring for refeeding syndrome (watch for edema, low phos) Weight increase of 0.2kg/day, supplement if not gaining weight; 1750-2000kcal diet to be increased by 250 kcal per day until goal calories met, meals per EBG (set time for meal, replace w/ 120% ensure if &lt;75% complete (either PO or via NG)) Check electrolytes daily and supplement w/ PhosNaK and/or MVI if abnormal (at BCH the protocol is to start both supplements on admission) Activity: Bed rest while orthostatic.

Derm: Atopic and non-atopic dermatitis, severe diaper rash, neonatal rash, anhydrosis, as well as delayed separation of the umbilical cord (LAD) Immuno: Recurrent infections, autoimmunity Family history of consanguinity or family history of immunodeficiency or unexplained childhood deaths puts a child at higher risk of having or developing a primary immunodeficiency ### Physical Exam Vital signs: Growth parameters General exam: Note dysmorphisms, including teeth and hair (abnormal in NEMO). Look for infectious sources (sinusitis, otitis, pneumonia, thrush, diaper rash) HEENT exam: Note tonsils (absent in XLA) and examine for thrush and other signs of infection such as sinusitis or recurrent otitis media CV exam: Note any cardiac anomalies including heart sounds, pulses, perfusion, and overall volume status as cardiac anomalies can be a part of certain syndromes associated w/ immunodeficiency syndromes (e.g.: DiGeorge Syndrome) Respiratory: Note symmetry of lung exam, quality of air entry, and lung sounds as pulmonary anomalies may be a manifestation of immunodeficiency syndromes GI: A thorough GI exam including abdominal exam for elements like hepatosplenomegaly and rectal exam for possible anal atresia is important GU: Primary immunodeficiencies can also lead to GU anomalies; assess for absence/presence of appropriate male/female organs in the correct number Derm exam: Skin exam for eczema/dermatitis (i.e. WAS, SCID, hyper IgE syndrome) as well as erythroderma (Omenn Syndrome). Note telangiectasia (AT), warts, granulomas, poor wound healing or ulcers Neuro: A thorough neuro exam may also hint at the etiology of an immunodeficiency (ataxia-telangiectasia), an infection such as meningitis, or may help elucidate an alternate cause of symptoms ### Diagnosis Initial labs: CBC w/ differential (note especially lymphopenia), chem7, albumin, urinalysis, ESR, CRP, quantitative immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE), specific vaccine antibody studies (tetanus, HiB, pneumococcal). Follow-up labs: HIV testing. B- and T-cell subset, complement screening (C3, C4, AH50, CH50), vaccine challenge (administer pneumococcal or other vaccine and measure titers 4-6 weeks later), Dihydrorhodamine (DHR) assay (CGD). Leukocyte adhesion defect testing (LAD). Advanced lab analysis: T cell proliferation studies (mitogen, antigen), T and B cell memory panels, NK cell function assays, Toll-like receptor assays. Immunodeficiency genetic panel. Whole exome or whole genome sequencing. ### Treatment Varies widely based upon the deficiency. Common therapies include prophylactic antibiotics, IVIG, bone marrow transplant. ## Indications for a Primary Immunodeficiency Evaluation - ≥8 ear infections w/i one year - &gt;2 serious sinus infections w/i one year - &gt;2 pneumonias w/i one year - FTT, poor weight gain, or abnormal growth parameters - Abnormal physical exam suggestive of syndrome - Recurrent skin or organ abscesses - Persistent thrush (mouth/skin), at &gt;12 months of age - Severe or overwhelming infection Infection w/ unusual organisms Need for intravenous antibiotics to clear infections Infections w/ opportunistic organisms (Aspergillus, Pneumocystis) Severe forms of viral infections (HSV, VZV, EBV) Complications from a live vaccine A family history of primary immunodeficiency Abn.

If they can, have they mounted a sufficient immune response to vaccines (ie. do they need vaccine titers)? - Low threshold for antibiotic use in the event that infection is suspected. Managing a sick immunodeficient patient: - Obtain blood culture and labs. - Give antibiotics/antivirals promptly. - Determine whether imaging/surgery is indicated (ie. drain an abscess). - Be aware of blood products given. Blood may need to be from CMV- donors, filtered to remove WBCs, and irradiated. - Replace missing immune components (ie. IVIG) "],

Trust them! They are fantastic and want to teach. 4 Residents: One will be on outpatient, one post-call (but will round), two there all morning Attendings (usually 4-5 of them): General Cardiology: Most patients are usually on this team. Heart Failure/Transplant: You will always round w/ the attending on this team, sometimes there will be a fellow too. BACH: Adult congenital. You will round w/ the BACH attending and fellow. Electrophysiology (EP): You should see the fellow every day. Pulmonary Hypertension: You will occasionally have patients on this service and will round w/ the attending. Primary Attending: Cardiology is a team sport, meaning there are multiple physicians on the care team. This is the patient’s longitudinal cardiologist who will check in periodically. Of note, there is also an NP team. This team is separate from the MD team during the day, but you will cross-cover them overnight and on weekends/holidays (which means when you are overnight, you will need to signout to the NP team in the morning). 5.1.0.2 Admissions You will have a few types of admissions. The main ones will be from the CICU, from the ED, and post-cath: CICU admission: Go with fellow to 8S (bring a COW) to get sign-out directly from the team caring for the patient. Write transfer note, enter transfer accept order, and perform transfer med rec. ED admission: Just like any other admission, except the cardiology fellow sees them in the ED and there is a consult note Post-cath: Usually you won’t get signout on this patient. The fellow will get some signout from the patient’s primary cardiologist. Ask them for more information and do some chart review for more information. 5.1.0.3 Resources Medical Team Coordinator: Should be your first stop for questions on basically everything non-medical. This includes scheduling a procedure, getting prior authorization for medications, discharge planning, how to put in a specific order, where the food is - really, anything and everything. They are AMAZING. Will also send you a welcome email before the rotation w/ excellent resources. Try to read them! Fellow: Cardiology is a great time to learn and the fellows are excited about the heart and want to teach. Don’t be afraid to ask them questions about the physiology and pathophysiology. Attendings: Similarly excited to teach. Many of them will bring a whiteboard on rounds and draw out the physiology of the patient. Feel free to ask them to do so if you want to learn more! 5.2 Disaster Planning 5.2.0.1 Know and use your resources!!! Fellow: Should always be your first call. Run the list w/ them multiple times a day and at night. Before they go lie down, “disaster round” w/ them and ask all the questions you have about what to do if X happens to Y patient. Nurses: They have been doing this for longer than we have and know these patients incredibly well. Ask them for tips as well. On midnight rounds, always say hello and ask them what they are worried about for each patient. Code cards: Carry them w/ you. They have lots of great information on them! CICU: They are right next door and can get over to the general cardiology floor very quickly. Don’t be afraid to call them. Always better to over call than under call them. 5.3 EKG Approach Paper speed: Standard 25mm/s → Small box = 0.04s, Big box = 0.2s Standardization marker: 2 big boxes tall = “full standard” and 10 mm = 1 mV 1 big box tall = “half standard” and 5 mm = 1 mV Limb leads can be in full standard while the precordial are in half standard 5.3.1 Ventricular Rate 300-150-100-75-60-50 rules if the rhythm is regular, OR Count the number of QRS complexes in the rhythm strip (10 seconds) and multiply by 6 (works even if the rhythm is irregular) 5.3.2 Rhythm Sinus rhythm = (1) P before every QRS, (2) QRS after every P, and (3) Normal P axis (0-90°, upright P waves in I and aVF) 5.3.3 QRS Axis Determine axis by looking at leads I and aVF: ↑ in I, ↑ in aVF = axis between 0 and +90° ↑ in I, ↓ in aVF = axis between -90 and 0° ↓ in I, ↓ in aVF = axis between -90 and 180° ↓ in I, ↑ in aVF = axis between +90 and 180° Once you’ve identified axis quadrant, find the most isoelectric limb lead: The QRS axis is 90° away from the most isolelectric lead Normal axis varies w/ age (newborn = rightward b/c RV dominance in utero, childhood = leftward b/c LV becomes dominant) Superior axis = AV canal defects, tricuspid atresia and large VSD or left anterior hemiblock Leftward axis in a cyanotic newborn is highly suggestive of tricuspid atresia 5.3.4 Intervals &amp; Segments 5.3.4.1 PR interval Atrial depolarization (P wave) and delay at AV node (PQ segment) The normal PR interval increases w/ age Prolonged PR intervals are seen in AV nodal block (heart block) Short PR intervals are seen in pre-excitatory conditions such as WPW Variable PR interval can be seen in wandering atrial pacemaker, multifocal atrial tachycardia and Wenkebach-type 2nd degree heart block Depressed PR segment may be seen in pericarditis 5.3.4.2 QRS interval Ventricular depolarization The upper limit of normal increases w/ age (0.07 s in newborns to 0.12 s in adults) A wide (prolonged) QRS is indicative of depolarization which proceeds independent of the His-Purkinje system or in which depolarization via the His-Purkinje system is aberrant This is seen in ventricular arrhythmias, pre-excitation, IV conduction delays and BBB 5.3.4.3 QT interval Ventricular depolarization (QRS) and repolarization QTc normalizes QT interval accounting for HR, calculated w/ Bazett formula: QT (sec) / √RR(sec) A normal QTc in the newborn = 0.47 s, it shortens in older children to 0.44, and then elongates to the normal adult values of approximately 0.45 s in men and 0.46 s in women Prolonged QTc is seen in congenital long QT syndrome, electrolyte derangements (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia), hypothermia and is caused or worsened by many medications 5.3.4.4 Q wave Ventricular septal depolarization, which proceeds from left-to-right and inferior-to-superior Small q waves should be seen in the inferior and left-facing leads (I,II,V5,V6 and III and aVF). Duration should not exceed 0.04 sec and amplitude should not exceed 25% of QRS wave in height Abnormally tall or long Q-waves may represent ischemia Q waves in V1 and V2 are always abnormal 5.3.4.5 U wave Small deflection often seen closely following the T wave, which may represent repolarization of the Purkinje fibers or after depolarizations w/i the ventricle A U wave is a normal finding if it is small (&lt;25% the amplitude of the T wave), there is an isoelectric segment between the T wave and U wave, and if the U wave is upright If any of these features are not met, the U wave may be pathologic Prominent U waves are seen most often seen in hypokalemia, but can also be seen in other electrolyte derangements, ventricular hypertrophy, LQTS and w/ antiarrhythmic therapy Inverted U waves are concerning for ischemia, ventricular hypertrophy or cardiomyopathy U waves are often more prominent at slow heart rates (&lt;65 bpm) If U waves are large (&gt;25% of the T wave amplitude) and there is no isoelectric segment between the T wave and U wave, they should be included in the QTc calculation (which becomes the QTUc) 5.3.4.6 ST segment Ventricular repolarization Elevation or depression &gt;1mm in limb leads or &gt;2mm in precordial leads is abnormal and is concerning for ischemia if seen in a territorial distribution (especially w/ reciprocal changes in other territories) or pericarditis if diffuse Concave “smiling” ST-elevation is often normal, as seen in benign early repolarization, however convex “frowning” ST-elevation is ominous 5.3.4.7 R/S progression R/S ratio represents the ratio of left to right ventricular forces. R waves in the right precordial leads represent depolarization of the right ventricle, and S waves in these leads represent depolarization of the left ventricle. Pattern reversed in left precordial leads. In newborn period of a FT infant, the RV is dominant and as such the R wave in lead V1 should be greater than the S wave As a child ages, the LV becomes progressively more dominant until late adolescence when an adult-type R/S progression is seen w/ small R waves and large S waves in V1 w/ large R waves and small S waves in V6 5.3.4.8 T waves Normal T wave pattern varies w/ age At birth, all T waves should be upright Over the first days of life, leads V1-V3 invert (V1 first, V3 last) and after 7-10 days of life it is pathologic for there to be upright T waves in lead V1 and represent RV strain if present It is normal for the T waves in leads V1-V3 to be inverted in children, and between the ages of ~8-20yo these T waves start to become upright (V3 first, V1 last) However, it is not abnormal for T wave inversion to persist into an individual’s 20s, and this is called a persistent juvenile T wave It is always abnormal to see an inverted T waves in leads V5 + V6 (ischemia or ventricular strain) Peaked T-waves are seen in hyperkalemia and elevated ICP and abnormally flat in hypokalemia 5.3.5 Chamber Size 5.3.5.1 R atrial enlargement (RAE) P wave height &gt;2.5 mm (2.5 small boxes) in lead II or tall initial positive portion in V1 5.3.5.2 L atrial enlargement (LAE) P wave duration &gt;2.5 small boxes (100 msec) in lead II. Notched in lead II or deep/wide terminal negative portion of p-wave in V1. 5.3.5.3 L ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) R wave &gt; 98th% in I, II, aVL, V5, V6 S-wave &gt; 98th% in V1 Supported by: Inverted T in V5 or V6 (strain pattern) Left axis deviation Left atrial enlargement 5.3.5.4 R ventricular hypertrophy (RVH) R wave &gt;98th% in aVR, V1, V2, V4R (or pure R wave &gt; 10 mm) S wave &gt;98th% in I, V5, V6 qR pattern in V1 Upright T in V1 (pre-adol.) suggests RV strain Right axis deviation 5.3.5.5 Strain QRS-T angle &gt; 90° (diff. between QRS / T axes) 5.3.6 Normal EKG values by age5 Values are 2nd – 98th percentile (mean) 5.4 Other Cardiac Work-Up 5.4.1 Chest X-Ray (CXR) Heart size: &gt;50-60% of thorax is abnormal on PA film (confounded by: poor inspiration, AP technique, thymic shadow) Lung fields: increased pulmonary blood flow (increased pulm. vasc. markings, engorged vessels) = sign of overcirculation Decreased vascular markings indicate decreased pulmonary blood flow Pulmonary edema and effusions may indicate CHF or left-sided obstructive disease Thymic shadow: lack of a thymic shadow in neonates should raise suspicion for 22q11 del. and associated cardiac defects Aortic arch: sidedness (left-sided aortic arch is normal) Heart border: Left or right atrial enlargement Rib notching: suggests the presence of collateral vessels, as can be seen in coarctation 5.4.2 What to do next… 4-extremity BP: Upper &gt; Lower (or less commonly R arm &gt; L arm) suggests obstruction of the aorta (e.g. interrupted arch, coarctation) Exception to the rule: L arm &gt; R suggests aortic obstruction w/ aberrant right subclavian Pre- and post-ductal O2 sats (measure on R arm and either foot) Hyperoxia Test: PaO2 &lt; 100 mm Hg on 100% RA suggests cyanotic congenital heart disease, &gt;200 suggests pulmonary etiology Pulse oximetry can be used as approximation if unable to obtain ABG. Consult Cardiology! 5.4.3 When to start prostaglandins After work-up, if high suspicion for cyanotic heart disease, start PGE1 (alprostadil) 0.01 mcg/kg/min as soon as possible Monitor for apnea and hypotension Consider securing airway if patient requires transport 5.5 Common Cardiology Concerns 5.5.1 Hyperlipidemia (HLD) See Weight Management EBG** 5.5.1.1 Screening When?

Irregular pulse on exam. 5.6.2.3 Pathophysiology Enhanced automaticity, triggered activity 5.6.2.4 Work-up EKG, 24-48hr Holter, chem10, TFTs May require echo or exercise testing (dependent upon severity) PVCs not coming from the RVOT (which should have a LBBB pattern with an inferior and leftward axis) should raise concern for underlying pathology) 5.6.2.5 Treatment Usually none Treat underlying cause (if one exists, e.g. a drug) Beta blockers or CCBs if symptomatic If refractory and associated with depressed cardiac function, radiofrequency catheter ablation 5.6.3 Premature Atrial Contractions (PACs) 5.6.3.1 Presentation Range: asymptomatic → palpitations, lightheadedness. Irregular pulse on exam. 5.6.3.2 Pathophysiology Enhanced automaticity, triggered activity 5.6.3.3 Work-up Similar to work up for PVCs 5.6.3.4 Treatment Rarely required. Beta-blockade can be considered for symptomatic PACs. 5.6.4 Sinus Bradycardia 5.6.4.1 Presentation Usually asymptomatic; lightheadedness, SOB, exercise intolerance or syncope and cardiovascular collapse; poor feeding, irritability and/or respiratory abnormalities in infants. By age: Newborn to 3 years: &lt; 90-100 bpm 3-9 years: &lt; 60 bpm 9-16 years: &lt; 50 bpm Well trained adult athletes: &lt; 40 bpm 5.6.4.2 Pathophysiology Conditioning (athletes), increased ICP, medications (beta blockers, digoxin, CCBs, steroids, analgesics and sedatives as well as alpha 2 blockers), structural CHD with sinus node dysfunction, anorexia 5.6.4.3 Work-up Assess for perfusion, history for causes including meds; EKG. 5.6.4.4 Treatment Observation if asymptomatic Treat underlying causes Consider pacemaker if symptomatic 5.6.5 AV Block Degree PR Interval Pathophysiology 1st degree AV block Prolonged PR interval Birth - 4 wks: 0.08-0.12 1-3 mos: 0.08-0.13 3-12 mos: 0.08-0.14 1-3 yrs: 0.08-0.15 3-5 yrs: 0.1-0.15 5-8 yrs: 0.09-0.16 8-12 yrs: 0.1-0.17 12-16 yrs: 0.1-0.18 Adult: 0.12-0.20 Increased vagal tone, idiopathic, acute rheumatic fever (ARF), Lyme dz, hypothermia, cardiomyopathy, electrolyte disturbances (hyperkalemia) 2nd degree AV block, Mobitz I (Wenkebach) Progressive lengthening of PR → non-conducted P wave - Usually AT the level of the AV node (does not progress to complete heart block) - Healthy individuals during sleep 2nd degree AV block, Mobitz II No lengthening of PR interval followed by sudden non-conducted P-wave Usually BELOW level of AV node (e.g., His bundle pathology)→ may progress to complete heart block 3rd degree AV block (Complete) Complete AV dissociation - Narrow QRS (junctional beats) vs. wide QRS (ventricular beats) → may cause hemodynamic collapse - Congenital heart block in infants of mothers w/ SLE (anti-Ro/anti-La Ab), L-TGA, heterotaxy - Acquired heart block: myocarditis, Lyme dz, ARF, MI 5.6.6 Supraventricular Tachycardia (SVT) 5.6.6.1 Presentation Paroxysmal palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath, dizziness or syncope w/ sudden onset and sudden resolution. HR characteristically invariable and is generally &gt; 220 bpm in infants and &gt; 180 bpm in children 5.6.6.2 Work-up EKG in SVT shows a (usually) narrow complex QRS, regular rate, +/- retrograde P-waves. SVT with abberancy or antidromic AVRT can be wide complex. 5.6.6.3 Treatment Vagal maneuvers (ice to face for babies, Valsalva maneuvers, blowing through a straw) Give adenosine 0.1 mg/kg (max dose 6-12 mg) as a rapid IV push through an IV as close to the heart as possible, followed by very rapid NS flush (this may be repeated at 0.2 mg/kg) Do NOT give adenosine if rate is irregular at all! Immediate synchronized cardioversion is indicated if the patient is unstable 5.6.7 Wolff-Parkinson-White Syndrome 5.6.7.1 Presentation Episodes of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia or asymptomatic/incidental finding on EKG 5.6.7.2 Pathophysiology Early conduction of atrial impulses to the ventricle defined by short PR interval, wide QRS, delta wave. Creates risk for SVT as well as pre-excited atrial tachycardias which can be life-threatening. 5.6.7.3 Work-up Echo to r/o structural heart disease (i.e. Ebstein’s anomaly); exercise testing 5.6.7.4 Treatment Catheter ablation is curative; antiarrhythmic medications prior to ablation 5.6.8 Ventricular Tachycardia (VT/VTach) and Ventricular Fibrillation (VF/VFib) 5.6.8.1 Presentation Range: asymptomatic → palpitations, chest pain, dizziness or syncope → hemodynamic collapse and rapid death 5.6.8.2 Pathophysiology Drugs, electrolyte abnormalities that prolong QT, underlying cardiac disease, inherited arrhythmia syndromes including LQTS, Brugada syndrome, CPVT and ACM can also predispose to these rhythms. Atrial tachycardias in patients with WPW can degenerate into VF. There are also “benign” varieties which can occur in young people with structurally normal hearts. 5.6.8.3 Work-up EKG, electrolytes, blood gas, and tox screen 5.6.8.4 Treatment VTach w/ a pulse: Consult Cardiology, follow PALS algorithm (consider antiarrhythmic medications) Synchronized cardioversion 0.5-1 J/kg initially, repeat w/ up to 2 J/kg. May be used w/ or instead of medical therapy VFib or pulseless VTach: CPR immediately Defibrillate initially w/ 2 J/kg, repeat at 4 J/kg w/ a maximum of 10 J/kg every 2 mins If not converted, use epinephrine (0.01 mg/kg = 0.1 ml/kg of 1:10,000 IV), may repeat every 3-5 mins Consider lidocaine, amiodarone and magnesium sulfate in consultation with Cardiology 5.6.9 Long QT Syndrome 5.6.9.1 Presentation Range: incidental findings, family history → syncope, palpitations, arrhythmia, seizures, or sudden death. Often provoked by exercise, strong emotions or diving into cold water. 5.6.9.2 Pathophysiology Congenital: Ion channelopathies (most common are LQTS1, 2 and 3; autosomal recessive version is called Jervell and Lange-Nielsen syndrome and is associated with sensorineural hearing loss) Acquired: Electrolyte abnormalities: Hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia) Meds: Macrolides, quinolones, metronidazole, multiple antifungals, most anti-emetics, SSRIs and TCAs, many antipsychotics, multiple antiarrhythmics, methadone and diphenhydramine) 5.6.9.3 Work-up EKG w/ prolonged QTc (upper limit of normal 450-460 ms), T-wave alternans, notched T-waves or low resting HR; electrolytes Genetic testing may be indicated 5.6.9.4 Treatment Adequate magnesium, potassium and calcium level Avoid any medications that may prolong QTc and activities known or suspected to provoke it Beta blockers, ICD placement and left thoracic sympathectomy are options for high-risk patients 5.6.10 Pacemakers 5.6.10.1 Positions Describe how the pacemaker functions and is programmed: Position 1: The chamber being paced (A = atrium, V = ventricle, D = dual Position 2: The chamber being sensed (A, V, D or O = no sensing) Position 3: Response to a particular sensed event I = a sensed event inhibits pacemaker output T = a sensed event triggers pacemaker output D = dual modes of response (i.e. a sensed event in the atrium inhibits pacemaker output in the atrium, but triggers ventricular pacemaker output w/ a programmed delay to mimic intrinsic AV delay) O = no response to sensed events) 5.6.10.2 Settings AAI: Atrial demand pacing and is an appropriate mode for patients w/ sinus node dysfunction, but should not be used for patients w/ AV node dysfunction VVI: Ventricular demand pacing and is used quite uncommonly – results in loss of AV synchrony and can result in a type of cardiomyopathy called pacemaker syndrome (signs and symptoms similar to heart failure) DDD: Dual chamber pacing- provides more physiologic pacing w/ preserved AV synchrony and may be used in patients w/ both sinus node and AV node dysfunction. This mode of pacing can result in four different rhythms: Normal sinus rhythm (pacemaker does not fire) Atrial pacing w/ a native QRS (pacemaker provides atrial impulse only) AV sequential pacing (pacemaker provides atrial impulse w/ a programmed PR interval mimicking AV node function followed by ventricular impulse) Atrial sensing and ventricular pacing (pacemaker provides ventricular impulse only at intervals mimicking AV node function) 5.7 Acyanotic Congenital Heart Disease (CHD) 5.7.1 Atrial Septal Defect (ASD) 5.7.1.1 Lesion 5.7.1.2 Basics Volume overload 4 types based on location and embryologic origin: Ostium primum: low in septum; can involve AV valve Ostium secundum: most common; near foramen ovale Sinus venosus: may involve connection w/ SVC, IVC, often associated PAPVC Coronary sinus (defect between CS and LA, not truly in atrial septum) Amount of L → R shunt depends on side of defect, SVR relative to PVR, relative LV and RV compliance PAPVC has similar hemodynamic consequences as ASDs 5.7.1.3 Presentation Hx: Often asymptomatic, may result in poor growth. When causing significant overcirculation, causes fatigue, dyspnea, CHF and can lead to pulmonary vascular disease (Eisenmenger syndrome). Paradoxical emboli. PE: Fixed and widely split S2. SEM caused by increased flow across PV, not flow through septal defect. Diastolic rumble if significantly increased volume of flow across the tricuspid valve. 5.7.1.4 Studies EKG: Enlargement of right-sided chambers, RBBB, RAD. Superior axis in primum ASD.

Symptoms occur as PVR decreases during first weeks of life and flow across the defect increases. Sx of CHF include, tachypnea, poor growth, sweating, feed fatigue, dyspnea. PE: Early or holosystolic regurgitant-type murmur. Smaller defects are louder because of higher pressure gradient across lesion. Large defects may cause very quiet murmurs (may only heard a loud S2). Volume overload can produce a left-sided heave. 5.7.2.4 Studies EKG: Normal or LAE, LVH, sometimes RVH if defect is large and RV is exposed to systemic pressure OR if pulmonary vascular disease has developed due to chronic overcirculation CXR: Can be normal, +/- mild cardiomegaly or increased pulmonary blood flow 5.7.2.5 Treatment May spontaneously close on its own, especially small muscular types Surgery if symptomatic or persistently elevated PVR; otherwise, may observe Repair is surgical patch closure or cath device closure Surgical/cath goal: Close the defect 5.7.3 Patent Ductus Arteriosis (PDA) 5.7.3.1 Lesion 5.7.3.2 Basics Volume overload Common in premature newborns Can be asymptomatic, or can cause pulmonary overcirculation, CHF and systemic hypoperfusion 5.7.3.3 Presentation Hx: Respiratory distress, feeding fatigue, poor growth, CHF PE: Continuous “machine-like” murmur at LUSB (though murmur can also be systolic only), wide pulse pressure, bounding or palmar pulses 5.7.3.4 Studies EKG: Often normal, can have LVH or RVH CXR: Normal, +/- increased vascular markings, +/- cardiomegaly 5.7.3.5 Treatment Indomethacin, ibuprofen or acetaminophen in preemies.

May have loud S2 due to anterior position of AoV. 5.7.5.4 Studies EKG: Q waves in right precordial leads, no Q waves in left-sided leads. Often have conduction system abnormalities including bradycardia and AV block. CXR: Dextrocardia or mesocardia may be present 5.7.5.5 Treatment Conventionally, only associated defects were repaired The newer anatomic approach involves the “double switch” operation, which involves an arterial and atrial level switch via baffling or a Mustard-Rastelli procedure if significant PS is present Often “training” of the LV w/ PA banding before the LV is made the systemic ventricle is required, unless significant PS or a large VSD is present Timing of surgery is a major challenge 5.7.6 Valvar Pulmonary Stenosis 5.7.6.1 Lesion 5.7.6.2 Basics Pressure overload Stenotic pulmonary valve, causing increased pressure on RV, TR, may be transmitted to RA Critical if ductal patency is required for pulmonary blood flow (these children require prostaglandins and early intervention) 5.7.6.3 Presentation Hx: If mild/moderate, asymptomatic.

Results in cyanosis and, if persistent, acidosis 2/2 right-to-left shunting. 5.8.1.3 Presentation Hx: May have “Tet Spells” Symptoms can range from severe cyanosis to predominantly pulmonary over circulation and volume overload resulting in heart failure depending on degree of RVOTO “Balanced” tets (moderate PS, Qp:Qs close to 1) may present only w/ a murmur PE: SEM at LUSB (2/2 RVOT obstruction, VSD does not cause murmur), absent or soft P2 5.8.1.4 Studies EKG: RAD, RVH, RAE, RBBB CXR: “Boot-shaped” heart. Decreased pulmonary markings. +/- right-sided aortic arch. Look for absent thymic shadow (seen in patients w/ 22q11 deletion). Coronary artery anomalies are common, may have absent ductus arteriosus 5.8.1.5 Treatment PGE if neonatal cyanosis to preserve ductal patency and pulmonary blood flow Acute hypercyanotic episode: Decrease PVR: Supplemental O2, morphine, bicarb Increase SVR: Knees to chest, alpha-1 agonists Increase systemic venous return Beta blockers may be used to prevent infundibular spasm Surgical repair: Patch closure of VSD and relieve RVOT obstruction (may require muscle bundle resection, patch augmentation of RVOT which may be valve-sparing or a transannular patch).

Myofibrillar disarray and hypertrophy of the LV, most commonly the interventricular septum → LVOT obstruction and diastolic dysfunction (though other patterns of hypertrophy are seen). Associated with some syndromes (i.e. Noonan syndrome). 5.11.1.4 Work-up EKG may show left axis deviation, LVH w/ or w/o strain, and pathologic septal Q waves in the inferior and lateral leads +/- LA enlargement Echo w/ diagnostic LV and septal hypertrophy +/- Cardiac MRI (to assess tissue characteristics and risk stratify), catheterization, EP studies, genetic testing 5.11.1.5 Treatment ICD if high-risk features of history of arrhythmia Beta-blockers or calcium channel blockers reduce obstruction and have antiarrhythmic properties Septal or left ventricular myomectomy and septal alcohol ablation are sometimes utilized Severe cases may require heart transplant 5.11.2 Dilated Cardiomyopathy 5.11.2.1 Presentation Signs of right-sided heart failure (peripheral edema, hepatomegaly, JVD) and left-sided heart failure (pulmonary crackles, cold extremities and weak pulses); often tachycardic, tachypneic, DOE 5.11.2.2 Physical Exam Systolic murmur (representing AV valve regurgitation) may be present w/ an audible S3 or S4 5.11.2.3 Pathophysiology Systolic dysfunction w/ enlargement of ventricles.

If right sided, may have abnormal liver studies. 5.12.0.5 Treatment Diuresis: Furosemide or other loop diuretic are first-line. Thiazide diuretics and spironolactone also may be used, usually in chronic CHF. Inotropes: Digoxin increases contractility. Dopamine or epinephrine may be used in sicker ICU patients. Afterload reduction: ACE inhibitors decreased SVR and may positively impact cardiac remodeling. Milrinone infusion has a similar effect and may be used in sicker patients. Other measures: O2 and correction of anemia aid O2 delivery. Salt restriction aids diuresis. Treating underlying illness (e.g. infection, arrhythmia, acidosis) can improve contractility. Sedation and mechanical ventilation can decrease demand on the heart. 5.13 Coronary Artery Anomalies 5.13.1 Anomalous Left Coronary Artery off the Pulmonary Artery (ALCAPA) 5.13.1.1 Presentation Recurrent episodes of irritability and emesis, as well as signs of congestive heart failure in infants (diaphoresis, tachycardia, tachypnea, respiratory distress, weak peripheral pulses and cool extremities +/- gallop or MR murmur) 5.13.1.2 Pathophysiology Left coronary artery arises from the pulmonary artery rather than left coronary cusp of aortic valve → massive ischemia once PVR falls (reversal of flow from coronaries into PA) 5.13.1.3 Work-up CXR: Cardiomegaly, pulmonary edema EKG: Signs of anterolateral ischemia manifest as pathologic Q waves (often very deep, but fairly narrow), inverted T waves and ST-segment elevation in leads I, aVL and V4-V6. Prolonged QTc may also be seen Echo is definitive, may confirm w/ MR/CT/angiography 5.13.1.4 Treatment Surgery to reimplant LCA to aorta and patch pulmonary artery 5.13.2 Anomalous Aortic Origin of a Coronary Artery (AAOCA) 5.13.2.1 Presentation Range: asymptomatic → massive ischemia and sudden death 5.13.2.2 Pathophysiology Variation in the number, shape or location of the ostia (origin) of the coronary arteries, usually non pathologic. LCA or LAD arising from the right coronary cusp leads the anomalous vessel to course anteriorly around the aortic valve, placing the vessel between the aorta and pulmonary artery and at risk for compression during times of peak cardiac output. 5.13.2.3 Treatment Anomalous LCA from the right coronary cusp (picture on L) is always treated w/surgery, even if asymptomatic, due to high risk of sudden death Anomalous RCA from the left coronary cusp (picture on R) is also associated w/ increased frequency of sudden death, though to a lesser extent; treatment is controversial 5.14 Pulmonary Hypertension (pHTN) 5.14.0.1 Presentation Acute → sx of R heart failure. Chronic → dyspnea w/ exertion and fatigue. Can lead to hemoptysis and sudden death from acute R heart failure from pulmonary hypertensive crisis May become cyanotic with acute increases in PVR if ASD present (which can preserve CO) 5.14.0.2 Physical Exam RV heave, +/- TR murmur, cyanosis, clubbing, RHF signs such as JVD, hepatomegaly, peripheral edema 5.14.0.3 Pathophysiology Mean pulmonary atrial pressure &gt;20 mmHg. Causes are: Pulmonary arterial HTN Left heart dysfunction/obstruction Lung pathology or hypoxemia Chronic thromboembolism Multifactorial 5.14.0.4 Work-up EKG: RV hypertrophy often w/ accompanying strain (excessive right-sided forces for age w/ QRS-T angle &gt; 90 degrees). In children, upright T-waves in V1 after 7-10 days of life suggests this diagnosis as can a qR pattern in V1. CXR: May show mildly enlarged cardiac chambers, underlying lung disease, and prominent proximal pulmonary arteries w/ diminished distal pulmonary vasculature Echo: May show enlarged or hypertrophied right-sided chambers. Position of the interventricular septum (which should bow into the usually low pressure RV) may flatten or bow into the LV. If present, the TR jet can estimate systolic RV pressure using the Bernoulli equation (upper limit of normal is ~25mmHg). Septal defects may also be used in this manner. Cardiac catheterization is definitive diagnosis. Mean PA pressures &gt;20 mmHg are diagnostic. Often performed w/ pulmonary vasodilator testing to assess response to potential therapies. 5.14.0.5 Treatment Correct underlying cause! Counseling to avoid strenuous activity (esp. isometric exertion), avoid alpha adrenergic meds Pulmonary vasodilators can be used: Remodulin (IV infusion of trepostinil), Bosentan (endothelin receptor antagonist), Sildenafil (phosphodiesterase inhibitor), nifedipine (calcium channel blocker), iNO, supplemental oxygen 5.15 Cardiac Infections 5.15.1 Myocarditis 5.15.1.1 Presentation Range: asymptomatic → chest pain, palpitations, syncope, CHF w/ DOE and fatigue 5.15.1.2 Physical Exam Fever, tachycardia, ventricular arrhythmias, new murmur or cardiogenic shock (poor pulses, hypotension, cool extremities) 5.15.1.3 Pathophysiology Usually due to viruses (coxsackie B, adenovirus and enterovirus, and more recently HHV6 virus and parvovirus B19, measles, mumps, rubella, CMV, HIV, arboviruses, parvovirus, and influenza) or inflammatory conditions (Kawasaki disease, ARF) 5.15.1.4 Work-up Labs: CBC, inflammatory markers, cardiac enzymes, viral serologies, +/- rheumatologic screening if a systemic inflammatory process is suspected CXR: May show cardiomegaly and pulmonary vascular congestion/edema EKG: Non-specific. May show sinus tachycardia, arrhythmia, heart block, prolonged QT-interval, bundle branch blocks, abnormal QRS axis, diffusely low voltage QRS complexes (&lt;5 mm in full standard across the limb leads), non-specific ST-T changes, and diffuse ST elevations w/ PR depression if there is coincident pericarditis Echo: Useful for evaluating cardiac function and ruling out other causes of cardiac dysfunction, but cannot definitively diagnosis myocarditis Gadolinium-enhanced cardiac MRI that shows late gadolinium enhancement is suggestive of myocarditis, though is somewhat non-specific Endomyocardial biopsy via right heart cath may be diagnostic, but has low sensitivity due to sampling error 5.15.1.5 Treatment Largely supportive: Tx CHF w/ diuretics, ACE inhibitors, +/- milrinone (can worsen hypotension), inotropes, +/- antiarrhythmics, anticoagulant IVIG used but data is limited Fulminant myocarditis may require mechanical support with ECMO or VAD 5.15.2 Endocarditis 5.15.2.1 Presentation Subacute: Low-grade fevers, myalgias, fatigue, weight loss, exercise intolerance Acute: Rapid, fulminant, high fevers, toxic appearance (usually S. aureus) 5.15.2.2 Physical Exam Tachycardia, new murmur, splenomegaly, Roth spots (retinal lesion), Janeway lesions (palms/soles), Osler nodes (painful fingers and toes), splinter hemorrhages 5.15.2.3 Pathophysiology Bacteria (usually S. aureus, viridans strep, coag neg staph) that damage endothelium and set off clotting cascade leading to fibrin deposition over valve 5.15.2.4 Work-up Labs: BCx x3 initially, then daily if persistently febrile. CBC w/ elevated WBC, +/- anemia. Elevated ESR and CRP. Microscopic hematuria due to renal emboli. CXR: May show evidence of CHF or septic emboli EKG: May show AV conduction defects if vegetation involves conduction system Echo: TTE is adequate in most kids; TEE indicated only if TTE inadequate. Absence of vegetations on echo does not exclude a clinical dx of endocarditis. 5.15.2.5 Diagnosis Pathologic criteria: Pathologic lesions on histology (vegetation/abscess w/ active IE), OR microorganism identified on histology or culture of vegetation/abscess Clinical criteria (Modified Duke Criteria): 2 major, OR 1 major + 3 minor, OR 5 minor: Major Criteria: (1) &gt; 2 blood cultures w/ typical organisms (or persistently positive); (2) Endocardial involvement (vegetation, abscess, new valvular regurgitation) Minor Criteria: (1) Predisposition; (2) Fever; (3) Vascular phenomena (septic emboli, mycotic aneurysm, ICH, Roth spots, Janeway lesion); (4) Immunologic phenomena (GN, RF+, Osler nodes) 5.15.2.6 Treatment Antibiotics: Empirically cover Staph, Strep, Enterococci (e.g. vanc) → tailor based on sensitivities; generally x4-6 wks Surgery: If persistent bacteremia despite adequate abx therapy, heart failure, progressive valvular dysfunction, conduction tissue involvement, or large lesion at high risk of embolizing 5.15.2.7 Complications Heart failure (most common indication for surgery), perivalvular abscess (suspect if new conduction abnormality or persistent bacteremia), pericarditis, septic emboli, metastatic abscess, embolic stroke, renal infarction 5.15.3 Pericarditis 5.15.3.1 Presentation Chest pain (often relieved by leaning forward) +/- tachypnea and dyspnea 5.15.3.2 Physical Exam Friction rub, weak apical impulse, poor perfusion, hepatomegaly 5.15.3.3 Pathophysiology Infectious (bacterial, viral (Coxsackie), fungal, parasitic, TB), inflammatory (ARF, SLE, uremia, radition, drugs), traumatic, oncologic, chronic (constrictive pericarditis) 5.15.3.4 Work-up EKG w/ decreased precordial voltages indicate effusion; diffuse ST elevation w/ PR depression is seen in pericarditis. Electrical alternans may manifest as QRS of alternating amplitude or axis, and is seen in pericardial effusion. There may be diffusely low voltage (&lt; 5mm in full standard) QRS complexes in the limb leads. 5.15.3.5 Treatment NSAIDs and colchicine, treat underlying cause 5.16 References Lehman, et al., Transient focal neurologic symptoms correspond to regional cerebral hypoperfusion by MRI: A stroke mimic in children.

For cancer, HCT allows high dose chemotherapy to be used +/- a graft-vs-leukemia effect (if allogeneic). For non-malignant disorders (hemoglobinopathy, immunodeficiency, primary HLH), the HCT can replace genetically defective cells with those that do not have the mutation. As you can imagine, whether you are treating a malignant or non-malignant disorder fundamentally affects how you approach a transplant. For malignant disease, it is more important to use myeloablative conditioning (MAC) to try to completely eliminate all cancer cells. By contrast, when treating a non-malignant disorder, a mixed chimerism may sometimes be sufficient to provide functional cure, and reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) is an option. It is less about eliminating all patient bone marrow cells and more about sneaking in enough that work (note: if too few sneak in, they might be kicked out by patient = “graft failure”). With MAC, there is higher potential for graft-vs-host disease (GvHD), given the high amounts of inflammation that occur, which is usually a precipitating factor for the GvH response. There are also more long-term sequelae of aggressive chemotherapy. RIC is theoretically gentler with regards to GvHD and chemotoxicity. However, as mentioned, it increases the risk of graft failure, which is a scenario where the patient rejects the graft and can lead to disease recurrence with autologous recovery (bad) or pancytopenia (also bad). The major risks of transplant are: chemotoxicity, veno-occlusive disease (VOD), transplant associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA), infection, GvHD, and graft failure. We will try to outline the clinical and laboratory signs of these complications in the coming sections, along with the approximate time period after transplant one might expect them. Treatments shown reflect common practice at DFCI, but there is considerable variation across institutions. Overall, transplant outcomes have significantly improved over the past few decades. While we see the sickest patients in our ICU, there are many we don’t see that are now thriving at home. The cell therapy field is also witnessing some exciting innovations. Using gene editing, there are gene-corrected autologous HCTs being tested for a variety of monogenic disorders. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte therapies are being refined for viremia that is refractory to standard treatment. And, of course, how could we fail to mention CAR T? 6.2 Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT) 6.2.1 Graft CD34+ cells: the hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) that help reconstitute blood cell lineages in a patient T-cells: donor T-cells can recognize patient as foreign → GvHD (bad) or graft-vs-leukemia effect = GvL (good); meanwhile, residual host T cells can recognized donor as foreign → graft failure (bad) Other mixed immune cells 6.2.2 Donor Types Everyone has a donor; some are more ideal than others Autologous Donor - self To rescue a patient’s hemopoietic system after high-dose chemotherapy for solid tumors (not appropriate for other indications) Allogeneic – Related Donor Matched Related Donor (MRD) - biological sibling bone marrow aspirated from sibling shortly before planned transplant cord blood can be used if newly born sibling is known to be a match prior to birth best outcomes; preferable for HCT for non-malignant disorders to optimize risk:benefit ratio Haplo-identical Donor – biological parent not first choice but option that is available for most patients may have pre- or post-transplant T-cell depletion to reduce risk of GvHD (see below) Allogeneic – Unrelated (Matched or Mismatched) Sources: peripheral blood stem cells (PBSCs), bone marrow, cord blood (marrow most common at DFCI) Higher chance of GvHD and graft failure Can T-cell deplete via positive or negative selection Positive selection – CD34+ HSCs isolated using magnetic beads and are used as product for transfusion (most common for PBSCs) Negative selection – giving patients serotherapy like anti-thymocyte globulin (ATG) or alemtuzumab (Campath™) to kill the T-cells in the graft 6.2.3 Conditioning Regimens Myeloablative (MAC) Common regimens: busulfan-fludarabine “Bu/Flu” or Busulfan-Cyclophosphamide “Bu/Cy” Reduced Intensity (RIC) Common regimens: Fludarabine-Melphalan-Campath “Flu/Mel/Campath” Considerations based on disease indication and any baseline organ damage 6.2.4 Timeline Patients are admitted 1-2 weeks before stem cell infusion, during which they have central access placed and receive their conditioning regimen to deplete their hematopoietic cells (max effect delayed per below) Stem cell infusion occurs on Day 0; the WBC nadir is usually Day +8-12 Engraftment (ANC &gt;500 x3 days) generally occurs by Day +14-28 depending on the cell source and conditioning used Criteria for discharge: neutrophil engraftment, no active infections, patient able to PO or tolerate NG (usually a 6-week admission at minimum) 6.2.5 Complications All patients experience complications; some are inevitable (e.g. mucositis) and we work through them; others we try hard to avoid (e.g. graft failure) BEFORE STEM CELL INFUSION Anaphylactic/infusion reactions to agents (e.g. DMSO, ATG, Campath™) DURING STEM CELL INFUSION Generally uneventful, but watch blood pressure AFTER STEM CELL INFUSION Mucositis Chemotherapy kills the mucosal layer in the GI tract; extremely painful; patients can’t eat and require TPN for a period of time Pancytopenia (before engraftment occurs) Infection, anemia, and bleeding risks Handle with transfusions and infection prophylaxis Aid neutrophil recovery by giving Filgrastim Graft-vs-host Disease Risk factors: HLA mismatch, MAC, non-CD34 selected PBSC graft Acute GvHD usually onsets within the first 100 days Skin rash, diarrhea, liver toxicity (not necessarily all) Chronic GvHD onsets after Day +100 More scleroderma like, lung disease (bronchiolitis obliterans), joint pain Prophylaxis with: Calcineurin inhibitor (Cyclosporine &gt;&gt; tacrolimus) + methotrexate (MTX) or CellCept (MMF) Treatment with: steroids Veno-occlusive Disease (a.k.a. SOS) Risk factors: MAC, busulfan, pre-existing liver dysfunction Usually onsets within first 28 days of transplant Warning signs: weight gain, ascites, painful hepatomegaly, rising LFTs, persistent thrombocytopenia May need PICU admission for hepatopulmonary or hepatorenal syndrome (respiratory failure, AKI) Prophylaxis with: ursodiol, Vit-E Treatment with: defibrotide Transplant-associated Thrombotic Microangiopathy (TA-TMA) Systemic endothelial injury → Coombs negative hemolysis (schistocytes!), platelet aggregation with microvascular thrombi (possible organ damage), and subsequent thrombocytopenia Possible signs: de novo anemia and thrombocytopenia, schistocytes, new hypertension, elevated LDH, proteinuria, and terminal complement activation (sC5b-C9) Treatment: eculizumab (terminal complement inhibitor) Graft Failure (GF) If patient never achieves engraftment or if it is subsequently lost Risk factors: RIC, HLA mismatch, certain conditioning agents May require stem cell boost or second transplant to overcome pancytopenia CMV Highest risk when there is a mismatch between donor/recipient status prior to transplant; monitor with weekly PCR Viremia may take off when engraftment occurs Challenge is that effective agents like valganciclovir are myelosuppressive, which can damage the graft Symptoms: diarrhea, pneumonia, ocular disease EBV B-cells infected with EBV proliferate but T-cells usually keep them in check With GvHD prophylaxis, T-cells are inhibited and patient can develop post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PTLD) Adenovirus, BK virus, HHV6, CLABSI Posterior Reversible Encephalopathy Syndrome (PRES) Associated with use of calcineurin inhibitors (e.g. cyclosporine and tacrolimus) used for GvHD prophylaxis AMS/seizures; diagnosed on MRI Late effects of chemotherapy Patients get echocardiogram, PFTs, LFTs, kidney function tests prior to transplant as baseline Women may be offered egg preservation Can develop endocrine and reproductive issues, lung damage 6.3 Cytotoxic T Lymphocytes (CTLs) 6.3.1 Concept CMV, EBV, and ADV are common viruses that can have high morbidity/mortality in immunocompromised patients that are s/p HCT Current antiviral therapies like cidofovir &amp; valganciclovir may tackle viremia, but they do not address the root cause, which is the lack of virus-specific T cells; this is where CTLs can help Steps to making a CTL therapy Matched donor or third party donor provides peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) These are exposed to viral antigens in vitro Virally activated T-cells are isolated from the T-cell milieu, expanded, and infused into patient Because T-cells are mostly specific to virus, there is less GvHD than with an unselected donor lymphocyte infusion To increase efficiency of manufacturing, tri-valent CTLs (specific to CMV, EBV, &amp; ADV) are under investigation 6.4 Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cells 6.4.1 Concept T-cells are genetically engineered to actively target cells that express tumor specific antigens First FDA approvals came in 2017 with Kymriah™ and Yescarta™ for treatment of B-cell ALL and lymphoma (CD19-specific CAR) Steps to making a CAR T therapy Autologous T-cells isolated from a patient T-cells are genetically modified to express CARs CAR T-cells are expanded in vitro Patient undergoes lymphodepleting chemotherapy CAR T therapy is infused What is a CAR? Synthetic protein construct Extra-cellularly, there is a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) that recognizes tumor cell surface antigens Intracellularly, there is a co-stimulatory domain (e.g. CD28, 4-1BB, ICOS) that provides the necessary co-stimulation signal and a T-cell intracellular signaling domain (CD3z) The extra- and intra-cellular domains are connected by a transmembrane fragment Who gets it? At DFCI, CAR T is used as a bridge to transplant; ideally a patient with leukemia will be “minimal-residual-disease” (MRD) negative and then get a HCT as consolidation therapy However, if they are MRD+, CAR T can be used to get them into full remission before HCT; other places may not proceed to HCT…it is so new that we are still getting the data for what recommendations should be 6.4.2 Complications Cytokine Release Syndrome (CRS) CAR T-cells are engineered to be activated (intrinsic co-stimulation) Within days of administration, especially if high tumor burden, can have surge of pro-inflammatory cytokines At its worst, this can lead to multi-organ failure and death Prevention: lower disease burden, monitor closely Treatment: tocilizumab Neurotoxicity Altered mental status, myoclonus, and seizures have been witnessed with CD19 CAR T Unknown pathophysiology; appears to be reversible 6.5 Emerging Cellular Therapies 6.5.1 Currently in Clinical Trials Gene-edited autologous HCT For monogenic disorders (sickle cell, HLH, IPEX) Still have to improve conditioning regimen to be less toxic Next Generation CAR T Extension to solid tumors and additional liquid tumors Built in safety mechanisms to prevent CRS (suicide genes) Built in features to prevent T-cell exhaustion and to assist with solid tumor penetration Multivalency to respond to combinations of antigens Linkage of CAR to T-reg to apply same principal to autoimmunity Regulatory T-cells (T-reg) therapy For GvHD and autoimmune disease Working on preventing phenotype switching in vivo Mesenchymal Stromal Cell therapy For GvHD and autoimmune disease Working on improving efficacy Combined marrow and organ transplant For inducing tolerance to solid organ transplantation Most evidence for combined marrow and kidney transplantation, with some evidence for lung "],

FiO2 can be adjusted to improve oxygenation as well. Mechanism: Alveolar recruitment improved, which improves oxygenation through better V/Q matching Indications: Hypoxic respiratory failure, obstructive sleep apnea, upper airway obstruction Considerations: No “breaths” delivered, so patient MUST be spontaneously breathing 7.5.2.3 Bilevel Positive Airway Pressure (BiPAP) Provides inspiratory pressure (IPAP) (compared to PIP), and expiratory pressure (EPAP) (compared to PEEP). Can also adjust FiO2 to improve oxygenation. Mechanism: In addition to alveolar recruitment, delta pressure (IPAP - EPAP) influences tidal volume to improve ventilation (Minute Ventilation = Tidal Volume x Respiratory Rate). IPAP can also reduce work of breathing. Indications: Hypoxic, hypercarbic or mixed respiratory failure Considerations: Although you can set a mandatory breath rate in certain BiPAP modes, machine breaths that are not aligned w/ patient efforts do not result in good tidal volumes due to the noninvasive interface; therefore not a good choice for patients w/ inconsistent respiratory drive. Relatively contraindicated in patients w/ altered mental status or who cannot protect their airway (ie. no cough or gag) from aspiration. 7.5.2.4 Weaning NIV Support Refer to ICP SCAMP for pathway Criteria for weaning (must meet 4/5): CV stability (HR and BP wnl for age or at patient baseline) Work of breathing none to mild FiO2 &lt; 40% tcCO2 or pCO2 at baseline or wnl Afebrile Criteria for sprinting from NIV: Clinical stability on goal setting for 4 hrs Tolerating airway clearance measures/suctioning Markers of intolerance to sprinting (if at any time 2 or more markers shown, resume NIV): Tachypnea increased tcCO2, etCO2 or pCO2 increased by 10 Work of breathing increased from none/mild to moderate or severe FiO2 increased to &gt; 50% or NC &gt;2 LPM from time of initiation of sprint 7.5.3 Mechanical Ventilation (MV) 7.5.3.1 Glossary MBR (mandatory breath rate): # of breaths the ventilator will deliver to patient per minute (vent will ensure patient receives breaths if patient not spontaneously triggering the ventilator) RR: MBR plus whatever spontaneous breaths the patient takes (breaths above MBR may or may not be supported depending on mode) PIP (peak inspiratory pressure): Highest pressure the patient will see during the respiratory cycle PEEP (positive end expiratory pressure): Pressure the lungs see during expiration (helps keep the alveoli open during expiration and prevent atelectasis) TV (tidal volume): Max volume delivered to the patient during inspiration IT (inspiratory time): Time over which tidal volume is delivered ET (expiratory time): Time when inspiratory flow is not being delivered, generally longer than IT (basically what is left over after you have a certain number of breaths per minute w/ a certain Ti) MAP (mean-airway pressure): (Ti x PIP) + (Te x PEEP) / (Ti + Te) 7.5.3.2 General Principles of Mechanical Ventilation Improve oxygenation (increase PaO2) by recruiting alveoli and optimizing V/Q matching Usually done by optimizing PEEP, MAP, I:E ratio. Can also increase inspired O2 concentration by increasing FiO2. Both atelectasis and overdistension must be avoided Improve ventilation (decrease PaCO2) by increasing alveolar ventilation Adjust variables that influence RR, TV Remember: Lungs need to empty in order for new air from outside (pCO2 = 0) to enter (particularly in patients w/ obstructive physiology (asthma), which may require longer expiratory times) 7.5.3.3 Modes of Ventilation AC (Assist-Control) Every breath is machine supported and has the same parameters (PIP, PEEP, Ti), whether patient-triggered or machine-triggered Breaths can be triggered by patient (assisted breaths) or elapsed time if patient not able to trigger (controlled breaths) Risk of overventilation if patient’s spontaneous respiratory rate is high for other reasons (fever, agitation) or if ventilator is inappropriately triggering Can set to pressure control or volume control SIMV (Synchronized Intermittent Mandatory Ventilation) Machine will synchronize breath delivery to align w/ patient’s effort, but if patient is not triggering breaths frequently enough, machine provides mandatory breath rate to patient Often paired w/ pressure support ventilation (SIMV + PSV) to support breaths above mandatory breath rate Can set to pressure or volume control: Pressure Control: Set pressure, tidal volume changes based on compliance (∆V/∆P) Volume Control: Set volume, pressure changes PRVC (Pressure-Regulated Volume Control) Ventilator adjusts pressure depending on exhaled tidal volume every 3rd breath Optimizes lowest pressure possible to achieve set tidal volume by constant automated adjustments PS (Pressure Support) No mandatory breath rate, no set inspiratory time When patient triggers a breath, machine delivers a set level of pressure above PEEP Inspiratory time of breath determined by patient-driven inspiratory flow (flow cycling) - if patient is “satisfied” (inspiratory flow drops below a certain threshold from peak, because the patient stops actively inhaling), the ventilator will cycle into exhalation 7.5.3.4 Troubleshooting Desaturations on a Ventilator (“DOPE”) Dislodgement (of ETT): Mask ventilate, call staff assist Obstruction (mucus plug): Suction, call nursing &amp; RT Pneumothorax: Obtain CXR, consider needle decompression if concern for tension physiology Equipment failure: Bag-ETT to ventilate, call RT 7.6 Extracorporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) 7.6.0.1 Definition An extracorporeal circuit designed to provide prolonged pulmonary (VV ECMO) or cardiopulmonary (VA ECMO) support by removing blood from the native vascular system, performing gas and heat exchange and reinfusing the oxygenated blood into the body. Venovenous (VV ECMO): Drains systemic venous deoxygenated blood, oxygenates it and removes carbon dioxide, and returns oxygenated blood to the systemic venous system. Provides pulmonary support (blood still goes through native heart and lungs) and is effective in respiratory failure w/ intact cardiac function. Venoarterial (VA ECMO): Drains systemic venous deoxygenated blood, oxygenates it and removes carbon dioxide, and returns oxygenated blood to systemic arterial system. Provides cardiopulmonary support (some blood bypasses native heart and lungs) and is effective in patients w/ cardiopulmonary failure. 7.6.0.2 Indications &amp; Contraindications Indications Hypoxemic respiratory failure w/ PaO2/FiO2 &lt; 100 or Oxygenation Index (OI) &gt; 40 despite optimized ventilator settings (PIP &gt; 35 cm H20, PEEP &gt; 10 cm H20, MAP &gt; 18 cm H20; failure of high frequency ventilation) (OI = FiO2 * Mean Airway Pressure * 100/PaO2, note, multiply by 100 if (correctly) expressing FiO2 as a decimal; if using percent O2, don’t multiply by 100)) Persistent hypercapnic respiratory failure w/ arterial pH &lt; 7.2 refractory to all ventilation modes. Refractory cardiogenic shock Cardiac arrest Failure to wean from intraoperative cardiopulmonary bypass VA ECMO or ventricular assist device (VAD) may be used as a bridge to cardiac transplant VV ECMO is potential bridge to lung transplant in certain circumstances Contraindications Lack of reversible etiology of critical illness Irreversible, progresive, severe neurologic compromise Large intracranial hemorrhage prior to ECMO Severe bleeding Severe coagulopathy or refractory thrombocytopenia Unwitnessed out-of-hospital cardiac arrest Presence of Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) Order Pre-existing multiorgan failure 7.6.0.3 Pre-ECMO Initiation Type and cross, arterial blood gas, electrolytes, CBC, coags, lactic acid, LFTs, chem 10 Head US in neonates to rule out severe IVH Echocardiogram to evaluate cardiac function and for structural CHD 7.6.0.4 Titration Titrate to achieve an arterial O2 saturation &gt;90% for VA ECMO and &gt;80% for VV ECMO (there is mixing of oxygenated and deoxygenated blood w/i the RA during VV ECMO), and mixed venous O2 saturation of &gt;70% for VA ECMO Target normal lactates and arterial BP (measures of perfusion) 7.6.0.5 Complications Bleeding is the most common complication (30-40% by some estimates), can be life-threatening. May require immediate surgical intervention, brief cessation of heparin infusion or use of plasminogen inhibitors (i.e. aminocaproic acid). Thromboembolism is infrequent, but can be catastrophic, especially in VA ECMO where embolization is systemic Vessel perforation, dissection, or occlusion, resulting in distal ischemia (latter can be seen in femoral arterial cannulation, treated w/ placement of a distal perfusion cannula) 7.7 Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) 7.7.0.1 Definition Acute respiratory failure not fully explained by cardiac etiology or fluid overload Excludes patients w/ perinatal pulmonary disease CXR w/ pulmonary infiltrates (does not have to be bilateral) Increased oxygenation index 7.7.0.2 Pathophysiology No unifying pathophysiology for ARDS - can be direct injury (pneumonia, traumatic contusion) or indirect (systemic inflammation from sepsis) Overall, insult causes alveolar cell damage filling of airspaces w/ exudate. Over ~3 wks, granulation tissue formation occurs which leads to remodeling and fibrosis. Alveolar collapse leads to V/Q mismatch 7.7.0.3 Clinical Manifestations Respiratory distress out of proportion to underlying disease Hypoxemia Decreased lung compliance 7.7.0.4 Diagnostic Studies CXR: Commonly see bilateral infiltrates, although not required for diagnosis ABG: High A-a gradient PaO2 to FiO2 ratio is &lt; 300 7.7.0.5 Management Lung protective ventilatory strategies to reduce ventilator-induced lung injury Maintain TV 4-6cc/kg, use PEEP to improve oxygenation (continue increasing PEEP if FiO2 &gt; 0.6 and not hyperinflated). Target SpO2 88-94% (wean if &gt;98%), goal FiO2 &lt; 0.6.

(ask for timepoints, i.e., “before Christmas?”) Does it itch, burn, or hurt? When was the first episode? Where on the body did it start? Was it present at birth? How has it spread (pattern of spread)? How have individual lesions changed? (Size, shape, color, itch, bleeding?) Is there a family history? (eczema, acne, psoriasis, autoimmune disease) What has made it worse or triggered it? What have you tried for it? Did it help? Hx of atopic triad (asthma, allergies, atopic dermatitis)? New exposures: Medications? (Look at external med rec) Travel? Environmental? Ask if they brought the medications they are using 8.2 Describing Dermatologic Lesions 8.2.1 Primary Lesion Description of the “family” of a lesion Appearance Macule Flat, not palpable; color change; &lt;1cm (e.g., freckle, labial macule) Patch Flat, not palpable; color change; &gt;1cm (e.g., congenital nevus or large birthmark) Papule Raised; &lt;1 cm (e.g. mole, acne) Plaque Raised; &gt;1 cm usual flat topped (e.g. psoriasis) Nodule Raised;

thickening of outermost layer (stratum corneum) Crust: Adherent, dried serum, exudate or blood on the skin Desquamation: Thicker scale that is shedding off Erosion: Loss of superficial layers of skin (epidermis only involved, does not scar); erosions lead to ulcerations Ulceration: Loss of deeper layers of skin (extends to dermis, scars) Fissure: Deep linear cracks in skin Atrophy: Thinning of skin; can be in the epidermis, dermis, or subcutaneous fat Excoriation: Erosions due to scratching Lichenification: Thickened, leather-like skin, normal skin lines accentuated Scar/keloid: Permanent fibrotic changes that result from damage extending into the dermis, keloids extend beyond the borders of the original defect Umbilicated: Centrally indented 8.2.3 Color Descriptor Erythematous: Blanchable red or pink hue in the skin, indicates vascular dilation;

Lubricating, semi-occlusive, greasy, does not sting. Useful for smooth, non-hairy skin, dry, thick or hyperkeratotic lesions. Cream: Less greasy, not occlusive, may sting, could cause irritation, vanish when rubbed in. Useful for acute exudative inflammation, intertriginous areas. Lotion: Less greasy, less occlusive, may sting, pourable liquid. Useful for acute exudative inflammation (e.g. acute contact dermatitis) and on hairy areas. Oil: Less stinging, keratolytic (removes scale). Useful for the scalp, especially for people with coarse or very curly hair. Gel: May sting, greaseless, least occlusive, dries quickly. Useful for acne and on scalp/hairy areas without matting. Foam: Spreads readily, easier to apply, more expensive, cosmetically elegant. Useful for hairy areas and inflamed skin. Spray: Aerosols (rarely used), pump sprays 8.8.1 Quantities of Topicals to Prescribe When deciding how much topical to prescribe, think in terms of lesion size and body surface area (BSA) 1 Finger Tip Unit (FTU) = 0.5 grams topical medication dispensed from a 5mm nozzle placed on pad of index finger from distal tip to DIP joint = 2 adult palms = 2% BSA Example: How much topical medication should you Rx for 2% BSA BID x30 days? 1 FTU = 0.5 grams = 2% BSA 0.5 grams x 2 times per day = 1 gram 1 gram x 30 days = 30 grams Remember that children, especially infants, have a high BSA to volume ratio, which puts them at risk for systemic absorption of topically applied medications 8.9 Topical Steroids 8.9.1 Classes of Topical Steroids Potency Class Common Examples Class 1: Superpotent Betamethasone 0.05% G/O/L, Clobetasol 0.05% C/O/G/S/F, Diflorasone 0.05% O, Halobetasol 0.05% Class 2: Potent Betamethasone 0.05% C, Desoximetasone 0.25% C/ 0.05% G, Fluocinonide 0.05% C/O/G/S Class 3: Upper Mid Betamethasone valerate 0.1%/0.12%F, Diflorasone 0.05% C, Triamcinolone 0.1% O Class 4: Mid-Strength Fluocinolone 0.025% O, Hydrocortisone 0.2% O, Mometasone 0.1% C/L, Triamcinolone 0.1% C Class 5: Lower Mid Desonide 0.05% O, Fluocinolone 0.025%, Hydrocortisone 0.2% C, Triamcinolone 0.025% O/L Class 6: Mid Betamethasone 0.1% C, Desonide 0.05% C, Fluocinolone 0.01% C/S, Triamcinolone 0.025% C Class 7: Least Potent Hydrocortisone 1%-2.5% C = cream, G = gel, L = lotion, O = ointment, S = solution, F = foam Potency: Ointment (thickest, most potent) &gt; Gel &gt; Cream &gt; Lotion (liquidy, easier to spread) Look at the CLASS, not the percentage (e.g. clobetasol 0.05% is much stronger than HC 1%) Uses: Class 1 uses: Severe dermatoses over non-facial/non-intertriginous areas, especially good for palms and soles Class 2-4 uses: Mild-to-moderate non-facial/non-intertriginous dermatoses, okay to use on flexural surfaces for limited periods Class 5-7 uses: Consider when treating large areas (given likelihood of systemic absorption), also for eyelid/genital dermatoses 8.9.2 Side Effects of Topical Steroids Local side effects of topical steroids: Skin atrophy, telangiectasias, striae, acne or rosacea-like eruptions, allergic contact dermatitis, hypopigmentation Systemic side effects of topical steroids (rare d/t low percutaneous absorption): Glaucoma, HPA suppression, Cushing’s syndrome, hypertension, hyperglycemia Exercise caution w/ widespread use and occlusive methods (e.g. plastic wrap, bandages) For all steroids, do not use for more than 14 days per month. Instruct patients to use in pulse (a few days at a time) manner. 8.10 Sun Protection 8.10.1 Types of Sunscreen Physical Blockers Chemical Sunscreens - Blocks and scatters UV and visible light- Active ingredients include zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, iron oxide- Less irritating to sensitive skin and immediately effective - Absorbs light and re-emits energy as insignificant quantities of heat- Active ingredients are benzophenone, avobenzone, oxybenzone- Not as messy, easier to apply, less apparent white sheen 8.10.2 Choosing Sunscreen Sunscreens are best for protection against UVB and UVA rays “Broad spectrum” sunscreens are the best SPF 30 blocks 97% of sun’s rays “Water resistant” sunscreens need to be re-applied q2h Sun’s rays are strongest between 10AM - 4PM Good rule of thumb: “If your shadow appears to be shorter than you are, seek shade” Avoid sunscreen use in infants less than 6 months of age. Instead use protective clothing, such as long sleeve clothing and a hat w/ brim. 8.11 References 8.11.1 Additional Dermatology Resources American Academy of Dermatology Basic Dermatology Curriculum: Three-Week Pediatrician Rotation for Pediatricians LearnDerm by VisualDx "],

Once it becomes obstructed, it becomes inflamed and edematous which eventually leads to necrosis and perforation. Inflammation can also occur as a result of bacterial invasion without obstruction. 9.4.3 Clinical Pain begins in periumbilical region (referred pain) and then moves to RLQ Anorexia, nausea, vomiting, and fever Young children may not have classic signs and therefore many present with perforation Perforation can occur between 24-72 hours after symptom onset if not diagnosed. Perforation can present with high fevers, peritoneal signs, and/or sepsis 9.4.4 Physical Exam Pain on palpation in periumbilical region that migrates to RLQ Rovsing’s sign: palpation of LLQ causes pain in RLQ Psoas sign: increased abdominal pain when patient flexes right hip against resistance Obturator sign: increased abdominal pain when patient’s right leg is raised with knee flexed and then internally rotated at the hip. Rectal exam: may have tenderness if appendix is retrocecal. If perforated: guarding and/or rebound, or may paradoxically be quite benign 9.4.5 Studies If female, obtain urine HCG CBC: poly-predominant leukocytosis (WBC&gt;9, PMN&gt;65%) is strongly associated with appendicitis UA may show mild pyuria KUB: not indicated in most. may show fecalith, localized ileus, free air (if perforated), SBO in young child without prior surgical history is appendicitis unless proven otherwise US recommended if moderate to high risk (based on PAS): US: Positive if hyperemia, thickened wall, echogenic fat, fecalith. Interpretation heavily influenced by pre-test probability.

Evaluation and management of dental injuries in children. In: UpToDate, Wiley, JF (Ed), UpToDate, Waltham, MA. (Accessed on February 22, 2020.) 9.13.1 Avulsion The tooth is completely displaced from the alveolar ridge; the periodontal ligament is severed, and fracture of the alveolus may occur. Extra-oral dry time &lt; 60 minutes has an increased prognosis of saving the tooth. Primary (“baby”) teeth should not be replaced. If child cooperative, the tooth should be placed into the socket immediately (by the parent before arrival to care if possible). Otherwise, may be placed in a solution with order of preference: save-a-tooth &gt; milk &gt; normal saline. Solution should be chilled but tooth should not be placed directly on ice 9.13.2 Fracture Infraction: cracked tooth Enamel only (Ellis I - uncomplicated): tooth chipped, pain absent but may be elicited with manipulation. Enamel and dentin (Ellis II - uncomplicated): “yellowish”, tooth chipped with exposed dentin, sensitive to touch and temperature. Cover exposed dentin with calcium hydroxide. Care within 48 hours Complicated crown fracture (Ellis III - complicated): “reddish”, exposure of the pulp and central artery, increased risk of infection. Emergency dental evaluation Root fracture: May not also involve the crown. If the crown is not involved, root fracture suggested by mobility of the crown Alveolar fracture: causes dislocation of multiple teeth that move with palpation. 9.13.3 Luxation Injuries Involve the supporting structures of the teeth, including the periodontal ligament and alveolar bone 9.13.3.1 Concussion The tooth is neither loose nor displaced; it may be tender with the pressure of biting because of inflammation of the periodontal ligament. 9.13.3.2 Subluxation The tooth is loose, but not displaced from its socket; the periodontal ligament fibers are damaged and inflamed. 9.13.3.3 Intrusion The tooth is driven into the socket, compressing the periodontal ligament and fracturing the alveolar socket. 9.13.3.4 Extrusion The tooth is centrally dislocated from its socket; the periodontal ligament is lacerated and inflamed. 9.13.3.5 Lateral luxation The tooth is displaced anteriorly, posteriorly, or laterally; the periodontal ligament is lacerated, and the supporting bone is fractured. 9.13.4 Workup Determine if tooth is primary or permanent Indication for urgent Dental consult - Avulsed permanent tooth (after reimplantation whenever possible) - Extrusion &gt;3 mm or interfering with bite - Laterally luxated (displaced) teeth that interfere with bite (if not interfering with bite, will often spontaneously revert) - Intruded primary teeth - Fractured teeth when dental pulp is exposed (bleeding from central core of tooth) - Suspected dental root or alveolar fracture (e.g. tooth mobility, pain out of proportion when tooth is wiggled) - Suspected jaw fracture (posterior tooth fracture, jaw tenderness, and/or malocclusion) to obtain panoramic radiographs Imaging: consider XR to search for swallowed or buried (in laceration) tooth. Teeth have also been discovered in the lungs. 9.13.5 Treatment Reimplantation (while awaiting arrival of dental team…) - Avulsed permanent teeth should be reimplanted immediately, ideally within 15 minutes and up to one hour - Store in save-a-tooth (preferred, available in BCH ED pharmacy), cold milk or saliva if unable to reimplant - Handle the tooth carefully by the crown to prevent damage to the periodontal ligament - Remove debris by gentle rinsing with saline or tap water; do not attempt to sterilize or scrub the tooth - Reimplant manually - Keep the tooth in place by having the child hold it or bite on a gauze pad or clean towel. Uncomplicated fracture of permanent tooth: - Store tooth fragments in tap water to prevent discoloration - Dental follow-up within a few days to bond fracture piece or smooth a fracture Other injuries (infraction, concussion, subluxation) warrant outpatient dental referral 9.13.5.1 General aftercare Soft diet for up to 10 days and limit sucking (pacifier or digit) Continue brushing with a soft-bristled toothbrush Avoid flossing until healing has occurred Chlorhexidine mouthrinse for luxation of permanent teeth Tetanus prophylaxis, for dirty wounds, avulsed teeth, deep lacerations, or marked luxation injuries Antibiotic therapy is indicated for permanent teeth avulsions (&lt;8yrs: amox; &gt;8yrs: doxy) and management of secondary infections 9.14 Epistaxis Sources: Messner AH.

- Asymptomatic, requires nutritional support alone - Late (4-10 DOL) &gt;&gt; - Presents as severe neuromuscular irritability or seizure &gt;&gt; - Most commonly from excess phosphate intake in cow’s milk; mechanism unknown, thought that high phos may antagonize PTH secretion - Maternal Risk Factors: Diabetes, Vit D deficiency, AED use, hyperparathyroidism, or eclampsia - Neonatal Factors: low birth weight, prematurity, IUR, perinatal asphyxia - Hypocalcemia in setting of other illness: sepsis, RDS, hyperbilirubinemia, renal failure Miscellaneous - Hungry Bone Syndrome: Avid bone mineralization after recovery from severe mineralization defect (e.g., vitamin D deficiency) - Osteopetrosis: loss of osteoclast function - Citrate or Lactate administration (e.g., from blood transfusion) - Hypomagnesemia - Sepsis/severe acute illness - Pancreatitis: complex formation w/ fatty acids - Drugs: bisphosphonates, cinacalcet, foscarnet, chemotherapy 10.7.3 Clinical Manifestations Acute hypocalcemia &gt;&gt; - Tremor, muscle spasms, paraesthesias, tetany (Chvostek, Trousseau signs) &gt;&gt; - Seizures &gt;&gt; - QT prolongation, impaired contractility &gt;&gt; - Psychiatric symptoms (anxiety, agitation, hallucinations) Vitamin D deficiency: rickets, muscle weakness, hypotonia, growth retardation; in severe rickets, may see bowed legs or knocked-knees 10.7.4 Diagnostic Studies Albumin and/or ionized calcium to determine if true hypocalcemia If hypocalcemia confirmed send PTH, magnesium, phosphate, BUN, creatinine, 25OH-vitamin D XR for rickets: shows osteopenia, widening of the metaphysis, cupping/splaying of growth plate, formation of cortical spurs, fractures 10.7.5 Treatment Calcium salts PO for chronic hypocalcemia Calcium salts IV for acute hypocalcemia &gt;&gt; - Ca gluconate 100 mg/kg ( = 1mL/kg of 10% solution) &gt;&gt; - CaCl 20 mg/kg ( = 0.2 mL/kg of 10% solution) for emergencies only (irritant, causes necrosis if extravasates) Replenish magnesium stores or give vitamin D as appropriate &gt;&gt; - If initiating treatment for vitamin D deficiency, always give calcium along vitamin D to prevent hypocalcemia from hungry bone syndrome In hypoparathyroidism, give 1,25 vitamin D (calcitriol) rather than ergocalciferol/cholecalciferol because of decreased 1a-hydroxylation in the kidney If hyperphosphatemic, avoid [Ca+] X [PO4] &gt;55 because of risk of metastatic calcification 10.8 Hypercalcemia 10.8.1 Definition Normal values are age specific and vary between labs 10.8.2 Etiology 10.8.2.1 Parathyroid Related Primary hyperparathyroidism (adenoma or hyperplasia) Secondary hyperparathyroidism Tertiary hyperparathyroidism (only in chronic renal failure with chronic secondary hyperpara autonomous overproduction of PTH develops iso parathyroid hyperplasia) Familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (loss of function CaSR) 10.8.2.2 Increased Bone Reabsorption Malignancy (metastatic or PTHrP secretion) Hypervitaminosis D -Hypervitaminosis A -Immobilization 10.8.2.3 Increased 1,25 OHD Production Granulomatous disease (sarcoid, tuberculosis) Subcutaneous fat necrosis in neonates 10.8.2.4 Metabolic Disorders Hypophosphatasia (defective alk phos) Blue diaper syndrome (defect in tryptophan metabolism) Congenital lactase deficiency 10.8.2.5 Medications Thiazide diuretics Lithium #### Other Adrenal insufficiency, Williams syndrome, thyrotoxicosis, milk alkali syndrome, excess calcium intake, ECMO (mechanism not well understood but thought to be secondary to incr PTH) 10.8.3 Clinical Manifestations “Stones, bones, moans, psychiatric overtones” - Renal symptoms: polyuria, renal stones, nephrocalcinosis - Musculoskeletal system: Bone pain, joint aches - GI system: paralytic ileus, abdominal cramping, constipation, anorexia, vomiting - Nervous system: headache, personality change, proximal muscle weakness - In infants, failure to thrive - In severe hypercalcemia (&gt;14 mg/dL) can have lethargy and coma 10.8.4 Diagnostic Algorithm *subcutaneous fat necrosis often (not always) has incr 1,25 OHD 10.8.5 Treatment For mild/moderate hypercalcemia, if asymptomatic can monitor without immediate intervention For severe hypercalcemia (&gt;12 mg/dL) and/or symptomatic: &gt;&gt; - Increase calcium excretion: IV hydration w/ NS is first line; after hydration, may add, furosemide, &gt;&gt; - Decrease bone resorption: &gt;&gt;&gt; - Calcitonin: inhibits osteoclast bone resorption, promotes Ca and phos excretion. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - Initial dose IM/subq 2-4 units/kg every 12 hours, may increase to 8 units/kg every 12 hours to a max of every 6 hours. Most patients develop tachyphylaxis w/i 48 hours &gt;&gt;&gt; - Bisphosphonates: inhibit osteoclast activity. Watch for hypocalcemia; also for hypophos and hypomag. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; - Pamidronate dose 0.5-1 mg/kg in children Note: HD should be considered in patients who have serum Ca conc in range of 18-20 mg/dL and neurologic symptoms Primary hyperparathyroidism - parathyroidectomy "],

Do not give antibiotics! Toxic megacolon: Severe diarrhea + abdominal distension/peritonitis (+hx Shigellosis, pseudomembranous colitis, Hirschsprung’s, or IBD) Non-classic presentation of appendicitis: Age &lt; 5yo w/ small volume mucusy stools IBD: Bloody diarrhea + weight loss, fever, fatigue, extraintestinal findings 11.2.3 Work-up Toxic appearing: CBCd, retic, chem 10, BCx, stool cx (SSYCE), C. diff toxin, KUB, Abd US Non-toxic but significant dehydration: Chem10 Non-toxic but febrile + bloody diarrhea: Stool cx (SSYCE) Recent immigration, travel to underdeveloped country, significant farm exposure: Stool O+P Recent abx or hospitalization AND age &gt; 12 mos: C. diff toxin Chronic watery: Stool pH, stool electrolytes and osms, reducing substances, trial of fasting Chronic bloody (occult or gross): FOBT, fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin, CBC, serum albumin, ESR/CRP Chronic fatty: Fecal fat (quantitative is gold standard), fecal elastase-1, serum TTG IgA and total IgA 11.2.4 Interpretation 11.2.4.1 Stool Studies Elevated fecal calprotectin or lactoferrin: Intestinal inflammation Elevated fecal fat: Villous atrophy, pancreatic insufficiency Elevated stool Mg or Phos: Laxative overuse/abuse 11.2.4.2 Differentiating osmotic vs. secretory diarrhea Stool Osmolar Gap = Stool Osm - (2 x [stool Na + stool K]) Osmotic diarrhea = osmolar gap &gt; 100 mOsm/kg Maldigested carbohydrates draw water into the intestinal lumen (e.g. celiac, pancreatic disease, lactose intolerance) Stool volume decreases with fasting Presence of reducing substrates or stool pH&lt;6 suggests carbohydrate malabsorption Secretory diarrhea = osmolar gap &lt; 100 mOsm/kg Secretion of water into intestine exceeds absorption (e.g. cholera, ETEC, neuroendo tumor, hyperthyroidism, non-osmotic laxative use) Large volume stool that does NOT decrease with fasting NOTE: Many infectious diarrheas are mixed osmotic and secretory 11.2.5 Acute Management In a non-toxic child, start with appropriate re-hydration (see Gastroenteritis and Dehydration Clinical Pathway) Generally avoid antidiarrheals Antibiotics are not indicated for well-appearing child with acute bloody diarrhea 11.3 Acute Gastroenteritis 11.3.1 PowerPlans, Order Sets &amp; Clinical Pathways Clinical Pathways: Gastroenteritis and Dehydration 11.3.2 Presentation Diarrhea (&gt;2 loose/watery stools per day), +/- vomiting, fever, anorexia, cramping. Diarrhea usually lasts &lt;1 wk and not more than 2 wks (diarrhea &gt;14 days = “chronic”). 11.3.3 Pathophysiology Viruses (rotavirus, norovirus, enteric adenovirus, calicivirus, astrovirus, enterovirus) are a major cause → Low-grade fever, vomiting, and watery, non-bloody diarrhea Bacteria (SSYCE, C. diff) cause infiltration of mucosal lining → Fever, abdominal pain, bloody diarrhea, positive stool leukocytes Parasites (Giardia, Cryptosoporidia, Cyclospora, E. histolytica) 11.3.4 Management Dehydration score determines management: If severe, obtain POCT BG + lytes and start IVF Otherwise, oral rehydration solution (e.g. Pedialyte or ½ strength apple juice) NOTE: Theoretical risk that high osmolality fluids will worsen diarrhea and hypoNa fluids will lead to hypoNa, but one RCT demonstrated improved outcomes w/ ½ strength apple juice b/c Pedialyte = not tasty No evidence for bowel rest or bland diet 11.3.5 Anticipatory Guidance Very common childhood illness (children &lt; 5yo avg 2 episodes/year) Fecal-oral transmission. Illness usually begins 12 hrs to 5 days after exposure, and generally lasts for 3-7 days. Oral rehydration/breastfeeding must be continued at home. Return to normal diet as soon as can tolerate.

Spores extremely resistant. Toxins disrupt endothelial cytoskeleton → inflammation, necrosis. Usually associated w/ antibiotic use (esp. clindamycin, cephalosporins, penicillins), PPIs, immunosuppression, IBD (esp. UC) 11.4.4 Work-up Stool enzyme immunoassay (EIA) = high sens/spec. Positives auto-reflex to PCR. Stool culture is NOT helpful! Do not test if age &lt; 12 mos. Sample should be fresh (on ice if outpatient), and usually only one sample is needed to confirm infection Place on contact + hand-wash precautions while awaiting stool result 11.4.5 Management Initial, non-severe: Metronidazole (Flagyl) IV or PO 30 mg/kg/day x10-14 days, OR Fidaxomycin PO Initial tx failure, underlying IBD, or severe disease: Vancomycin PO 40 mg/kg/day (max 125 mg/dose) x10-14 days, OR Fidaxomicin PO Chronic-recurrent (&gt;3x): Fecal microbial transplantation 11.5 Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) 11.5.1 PowerPlans, Order Sets &amp; Clinical Pathways PowerPlans &amp; Order Sets: GI Inflammatory Bowel Disease Admit Plan, GI Inflammatory Bowel Disease Workup Plan, GI Inflammatory Bowel Disease Medications Plan 11.5.2 Crohn’s Disease (CD) 11.5.2.1 Epidemiology Onset in teens-20s and 50s-60s. Unusual in &lt; 5yo. 11.5.2.2 Risk Factors 200 risk loci associated with both CD and UC, and associated w/ with other autoimmune diseases (ankylosing spondylitis, psoriasis, Celiac) Family history, Ashkenazi Jewish heritage, European ancestry NOD2/CARD15 mutations (CD). Turner’s Syndrome (CD), smoking (CD), sedentary lifestyle (CD), poor diet (high animal fat intake, low vegetable/fruit intake, Vitamin D deficiency) (UC+CD). 11.5.2.3 Presentation Systemic: Poor weight gain, stunted linear growth, anorexia, delayed puberty anemia, fatigue GI: Early: Abd pain, RLQ mass (ileal involvement), bloody stools, perianal skin tags, fistulas, and abscesses. Primary sclerosing cholangitis. Late: Stricture formation, intra-abd abscesses, colon cancer (8-10y after onset) Extraintestinal: Erythema nodosum, pyoderma gangrenosum, arthritis, uveitis/episcleritis, nephrolithiasis, osteoporosis, thrombosis 11.5.2.4 Work-up High ESR/CRP, low albumin, low Hct, low B12, +fecal leukocytes, high fecal calprotectin/lactoferrin p-ANCA -, ANCA+ (80% of patients) Upper GI/SBFT/MRI/low dose CTE/WCE: Skip lesions, “cobblestoning,” aphthous ulcerations, narrowing or obstruction Endoscopy: Inflammation can occur anywhere in the GI tract from mouth to anus (but most commonly is ileocecal), patchy involvement, colonic aphthous lesions, linear fissures, rectal sparing, pseudopolyps, perianal findings (skin tags, fissures fistulae) Biopsy: Chronic inflammation, noncaseating granulomatous, transmural inflammation 11.5.2.5 Management Corticosteroids: Systemic, topical (enteric-coated or rectal), or GI-focused (Budesonide, Uceris) Aminosalicylates (5-ASA): Poor/minimal response in CD. Anti-inflammatory, not immune-suppressing. Timed release, enteric-coated, pH-release, rectal suppository or enema (only in mild disease). Immunomodulators: Thiopurines (azathioprine, 6-MP – check TPMT activity before starting), methotrexate. Take 2-3 mos to work so require a bridge (steroid or nutritional EEN) to manage acute inflammation. Biologics: For Infliximab (IV) &amp; adalimumab (SC) (anti-TNFa), need HBsAg, VZV titer or 2 vaccines, TB within 6 mos to initiate. Vedolizumab (anti-integrin) used mainly for maintenance of CD colitis, approved in adults. Ustekinumab (nti-IL12/23) used mainly for maintenance, approved in adults. Antibiotics (ciprofloxacin, metronidazole): Useful in mild active CD EEN: Formula-based diet that can be used in place of steroids, which is as effective as steroids at inducing remission. Particularly good in growth failure and SI disease. Surgery: For complications such as stricture, fistula, abscess formation and to remove isolated areas of bowel involvement Specific carbohydrate or anti-inflammatory diets: As adjuvant Use Pediatric Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) to measure response 11.5.3 Ulcerative Colitis (UC) 11.5.3.1 Epidemiology Onset in teens and young adults 11.5.3.2 Risk Factors See CD 11.5.3.3 Presentation Systemic: Similar to CD GI: Frequent, bloody/mucousy diarrhea, tenesmus, overnight stools, abd pain similar to infectious colitis Toxic Megacolon: Can be seen in both but more common in UC. Fever, tachycardia, dehydration, electrolyte disturbance, hypoTN/shock, abd distention, vomiting, severe pain, abrupt change from diarrhea to no/little stools. ↑ risk w/antimotility agents (loperamide or opiates). STAT abd XR + Surgery consult. Extraintestinal: Erythema nodosum, arthritis, thrombosis, PSC 11.5.3.4 Work-up High ESR/CRP, low albumin, low Hct, +fecal leukocytes, high fecal calprotectin/lactoferrin p-ANCA+ (60% of patients) Endoscopy: Friable colonic mucosa w/ continuous extension from rectum up to proximal colon, pseudopolyps, “backwash” ileitis, +/- gastritis Biopsy: Chronic mucosal inflammation in lamina propria, crypt abscesses 11.5.3.5 Management Corticosteroids and PO/PR 5-ASA, as with CD Immunomodulators: 6-MP (check TPMT activity before starting) Calcineurin inhibitors: Racrolimus, cyclosporine as a bridge to colectomy Biologics: Infliximab used for induction and maintenance. Vedolizumab used mainly for maintenance (UC &gt; CD), approved in adults. Tofacitinib (Xelganz) approved for adults. Surgery: Colectomy can be curative, but requires either ileostomy (undesirable) or ileal-rectal/ileal-anal anastamoses (complicated surgeries, prone to recurrence w/ any residual rectal mucosa) Specific carbohydrate or anti-inflammatory diets: As adjuvant Probiotics (VSL#3): &lt;ay be complimentary Use Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Activity Index (PUCAI) to measure response (Gastroenterology 2007;133:423-432) 11.6 Malabsorption 11.6.1 Carbohydrates 11.6.1.1 Presentation Frequent, watery stools 11.6.1.2 Pathophysiology Caused by: Pancreatic insufficiency (e.g. CF) → inadequate amylase; lactase deficiency (postinfectious or permanent); bacterial overgrowth/alteration of bowel flora (e.g. post-surgical, recent abx use); consumption of excessive or non-absorbable sugars (excessive juice consumption); inadequate absorption (e.g. Celiac) 11.6.1.3 Work-up Fecal pH &lt; 6 (can also be seen transiently in viral enteritis) Stool reducing substances &gt; 0.5%. Need fresh stool for this test! Breath hydrogen test used to detect lactase and sucralase deficiency (rare); or strict elimination of lactase and reassess clinically 11.6.2 Fat 11.6.2.1 Presentation Greasy, foul-smelling stools (steatorrhea) 11.6.2.2 Pathophysiology Caused by: Diseases affecting bile production/secretion; poor enterohepatic circulation of bile salts (e.g. ileal resection 2/2 short gut or Chron’s); pancreatic insufficiency (e.g. CF, Schwachman-Diamond) → inadequate lipase; Giardia Critically affects absorption of the fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E, and K 11.6.2.3 Work-up Spot fecal fat (Sudan III stain): Non-specific, but sample can be further tested for: Split fats (fatty acids) = more suggestive of malabsorptive process, vs. Neutral fats = more suggestive of pancreatic dysfunction 72 hr fecal fat (Quantitative): &gt; 5g per 24 hrs suggests malabsorption (diet during these 24 hrs should be &gt;35% fat or ~60g) 11.6.3 Protein 11.6.3.1 Presentation Edema, hypoalbuminemia 11.6.3.2 Pathophysiology Most commonly caused by pancreatic insufficiency (e.g. CF) → inadequate bicarb and peptidases Differentiate from protein losing gastroenteropathy (PLE), which is excessive leakage of serum proteins into the gut 11.6.3.3 Work-up Serum total protein, albumin Stool alpha-1 antitrypsin (for PLE) 11.7 Celiac Disease 11.7.1 PowerPlans, Order Sets &amp; Clinical Pathways PowerPlans &amp; Order Sets: Celiac Disease Plan, Celiac Gene Assessment, GI AMB Celiac Disease (Future) Plan 11.7.2 Presentation Classic: Malabsorption (FTT/wt loss, steatorrhea), abd pain, gas, bloating/distension, constipation or diarrhea, anemia, non-erosive arthritis, dental enamel defects, aphthous ulcers, dermatitis herpetiformis (pruritic papules/vesicles), neuropsych (ADHD, depression, HA) Can also be completely asymptomatic! Infants: Irritability, wasted extremities and buttocks, distended abdomen 11.7.3 Pathophysiology HLA-DQ2 or -DQ8 (predisposition, necessary for dz) + environmental trigger → antibodies to gliadin (gluten byproduct), tissue transglutaminase (TTG; cross-links and deamidizes gliadin peptides) → enterocyte destruction ↑ risk in T1DM, autoimmune thyroid dz, Turner and Down syndrome 11.7.4 Work-up Serologies: Anti-TTG IgA, anti-endomysial IgA. Always check IgA levels (IgA deficiency can yield false negatives)! Deamidated gliadin peptide (DGP) IgG if &lt; 2 yo or if IgA deficient. Biopsy: Intraepithelial lymphocytes, villous atrophy, crypt hyperplasia 11.7.5 Management Gluten-free diet is the only treatment currently available, but is hard to maintain as is $$ and requires very strict adherence Wheat, rye, barley all contain gluten. Oats often cross-contaminated unless explicitly stated. Tends to be low-fiber, so watch for constipation Sx should start to improve 2-4 wks into GF diet Trend TTG until normalized (usually by 12 mos on GF diet); improves after 6 mos. Follow Vitamin D and B12 levels, iron/ferritin PRN, thyroid. Check if immune against Hep B. 11.8 Gastrointestinal Bleeding 11.8.1 PowerPlans, Order Sets &amp; Clinical Pathways PowerPlans &amp; Order Sets: ED Gastrointestinal Bleed Plan, ICU GI Bleed Admit Plan 11.8.2 Presentation Upper GI bleed (UGIB): Hematemesis (vomiting (or NGT/GT output) of red blood or coffee ground-like material), and/or melena (black, tarry stools). Hematochezia in brisk/massive UGIB, or sometimes in infants due to short intestinal transit time. Lower GI bleed (LGIB): Hematochezia (bright red (BRBPR) or maroon-colored blood or fresh clots per rectum). Melena in proximal LGIB.

Should prompt further work-up or endoscopy. 11.9.4 Management Approach to GERD in a child: Goal is to differentiate between mucosal disease, abnormal esophageal acid exposure, reflux hypersensitivity and/or functional heartburn driving symptoms NASPHGAN diet and lifestyle changes. If no improvement → Step 2: 2 wk trial of H2RA (e.g. famotidine). If no improvement → 6-8 wk trial PPI (e.g. omeprazole). If no improvement on PPI or if unable to wean acid suppression → Step 3: Refer to GI (upper endoscopy +/- pH impedance testing) Approach to GERD in an infant: Remember, GER is physiologic in infants! Impt to consider feeding difficulties/oropharyngeal dysphagia/aspiration in ddx. Reflux precautions: Elevate HOB, paced feeding, hold upright for 30 min after feed, thicken feeds (Similac SpitUp/Enfamil AR or 1 tsp rice/oatmeal cereal per 1oz formula), avoid tobacco exposure. Specifically counsel that all infants should continue back to sleep, even with reflux. If no improvement → Step 2: 2-4 wk trial of hydrolyzed or amino acid formula, or elimination trials of cow’s milk and soy from maternal diet if breastfeeding. If no improvement AND severe symptoms (poor weight gain, feeding refusal) → Step 3: 2-4 wk trial of famotidine or omeprazole. Counsel caregivers on limited evidence of efficacy and ↑ risk of CAP PNA, GI infections, vitamin deficiencies, and fractures. If severe symptoms persist beyond 12 mos age → Step 4: Refer to GI 11.10 Pancreatitis 11.10.1 PowerPlans, Order Sets &amp; Clinical Pathways Clinical Pathways: Pancreatitis, Acute PowerPlans &amp; Order Sets: Acute Pancreatitis Plan, Acute Pancreatitis Critical Care Plan, ED Pancreatitis Plan, GI Pancreatitis Labs Plan 11.10.2 Presentation Epigastric abd pain w/ band-like pain to back, fever, N/V, ileus, jaundice/clay-colored stools 11.10.3 Pathophysiology Gallstones or biliary disease (30% of pediatric cases), congenital anomalies (e.g. choledochal cyst, pancreatic divisum), infectious (mumps, mycoplasma, coxsackie, influenza, salmonella, GNRs), drugs (valproic acid, L-asparaginase, steroids), systemic dz (CF w/ pancreatic sufficiency, Lupus, RA, HUS, Kawasaki, IBD), metabolic (hyperlipoproteinemia, hyperCa, DM), EtOH abuse, blunt abd trauma (e.g. handlebar injury), genetic (SPINK1). 10% will have recurrence of disease. 11.10.4 Diagnostic Criteria At least 2 out of 3: (1) Abdominal pain (see above), (2) Amylase or lipase &gt; 3 ULN, (3) Imaging compatible w/ pancreatitis (US, EUS, MRI/MRCP) 11.10.5 Work-up Chem10, amylase/lipase (lipase rises earlier, elevated for longer, more specific), lipids, albumin, glucose, LFTs. ALT &gt; 3x ULN has &gt;95% PPV for gallstone pancreatitis. Contrast-enhanced US to confirm pancreatic inflammation and assess for gallstones or dilated CBD 11.10.6 Management Refer to the Acute Pancreatitis Clinical Pathway. There are 4 components: Pain control: Ketorolac, acetaminophen +/- opiates Fluids: NPO x24 hrs w/ NS or LR (if calcium wnl) bolus(es) followed by 2x MIVF Imaging: Contrast-enhanced US Feeding: Trial enteral feeds at 24 hrs if clinically stable. Interval increases in amylase and/or lipase or mild vomiting should not delay advancing introduction of enteral feeds. 11.10.7 Complications SIRS, ARDS, abscess, pleural effusion, pseudocyst (patients require f/u RUQ US in 4-6 wks to assess for pseudocyst) 11.11 Functional Gastrointestinal Disorders (FGID) 11.11.1 Pathophysiology Hypersensitivity (visceral nervous system, CNS), motility disturbance, ?microbiome disturbance, psychological factors including caregiver stress, and abnormal responses to both normal and abnormal physiologic stimuli 11.11.2 Alarm Symptoms Blood in stool, multiple episodes of diarrhea &gt; daily, persistent fevers, weight loss, nighttime awakenings for pain or to have BM. CANNOT be FGID! 11.11.3 Management Each diagnosis has its own specific management pearls (see below), but these general principles apply to all: Pt/family education about FGIDs. Thorough understanding of diagnosis and clear motivation to overcome it is critical for patient and family. Language is important: Can be helpful to describe broadly as “hyperactive/overly sensitive gut nervous system” that needs to be “re-trained”; the word “functional” may be off-putting, so alternatives might be “sensitive stomach” or “irritable bowel” (as appropriate depending on specific diagnosis). Most important is reassurance (e.g. have ruled out other concerning diagnoses). Many families are actually accepting and feel relieved to put a name to the symptoms. Judiciously order labs/imaging only if alarm symptoms are present and after introducing possibility of FGID. CBT: Relaxation training, cognitive restructuring, modifying family response. Also important to address other psychological comorbidities. Antispasmodics (hyoscyamine, dicyclomine). TCAs or SSRIs if comorbid anxiety/depression. Identify and avoid food triggers (e.g. tomatoes/citrus, caffeine, carbonation, greasy, spicy foods). Inpatient: Consider Magic Mouthwash (AIOH/diphenhydramine/lidocaine/MgOH/simethicone) or hyoscyamine if “something” necessary (e.g. over a weekend) 11.11.4 Irritable Bowel Syndrome (IBS) Subtype may be Constipation (IBS-C), Diarrhea (IBS-D), or mixed/alternating (IBS-M or IBS-A) 11.11.4.1 Presentation (Rome IV Criteria) Recurrent abd pain, at least 1 day/wk x3 mos, associated w/: Defecation, change in frequency/form of stool. Look for association w/ excitement or stress. 11.11.4.2 Specific Management Probiotics (lactobacillus or bifidobacteria). Bio-psycho-social approach. Medications to target symptoms, but educate that goal is to improve rather than cure. Return to regular schedules/routines. 11.11.5 Functional Dyspepsia (FD) 11.11.5.1 Presentation (Rome IV Criteria) 1x/wk of: Bothersome postprandial fullness (uncomfortably full after regular-sized meal) w/early satiety, epigastric pain/burning 11.11.5.2 Specific Management Small, frequent meals. Time-limited empiric trials of acid suppression or prokinetics. Peppermint oil (IBguard). Limit fructose, sorbitol. Consider cyproheptadine if weight loss. Sulcralfate helpful for burning, best to use single dose at night. 11.11.6 Abdominal Migraine 11.11.6.1 Presentation (Rome IV Criteria) Paradoxical episodes of acute periumbilical abd pain lasting &gt; 1 hr, often i/s/o family hx of migraine. Must be completely asymptomatic between attacks. Note: This is a controversial diagnosis. 11.11.6.2 Specific Management Avoid caffeine. Ppx: Cyprohepatdine, propranolol. Abortive: Triptan (IV, intranasal), dark/quiet room. 11.11.7 Functional Abdominal Pain (FAP) 11.11.7.1 Presentation (Rome IV Criteria) Often vague, diffuse pain, almost never focal. Often occurs at times of separation (bedtime or school) and is better over summer, weekends, or vacation. 11.11.7.2 Specific Management If severe, consider referral to Functional Abdominal Pain Clinic 11.11.8 Cyclic Vomiting Syndrome 11.11.8.1 Presentation (Rome IV Criteria) Stereotypical episodes of intense vomiting separated by wks to mos, completely fine between attacks. Usually presents in 3-7yo, uncommon onset after puberty). Typically happens at night (e.g. before bed), and parents can often tell it is coming (e.g. child is pale). Often i/s/o maternal hx of migraine. Isolated vomiting should always raise concern, so need to r/o malrotation, inborn error of metabolism, increased ICP, UPJ obstruction, pancreatitis, and cannabanoid hyperemesis syndrome (often responsive to hot showers, topical capsaicin cream) 11.11.8.2 Specific Management See abdominal migraine management above, plus IV hydration and ondansetron PRN 11.11.9 Functional Nausea 11.11.9.1 Presentation (Rome IV Criteria) Predominant symptom is nausea. At least 2 mos of all of the following: (1) Bothersome nausea at least 2x/wk generally not related to meals; (2) Not consistently associated w/ vomiting; (3) R/o other medical condition causing nausea. 11.11.10 Functional Vomiting 11.11.10.1 Presentation (Rome IV Criteria) At least 2 mos of all of the following: (1) Avg 1+ episodes of vomiting per week; (2) Absence of self-induced vomiting or criteria for eating disorder or rumination; (3) R/o other medical condition causing vomiting 11.11.11 Rumination Syndrome 11.11.11.1 Presentation (Rome IV Criteria) At least 2 mos of all of the following: (1) Repeated regurgitation and rechewing or expulsion of food, begins soon after ingestion of meal, does not occur during sleep; (2) Not preceded by retching; (3) R/o other medical conditions, including eating disorder 11.11.11.2 Specific Management Can use strategies similar to management of habit disorders. Education on diaphragmatic breathing. 11.12 Newborn GI 11.12.1 Pyloric Stenosis 11.12.1.1 Presentation Immediate postprandial projectile emesis, “hungry vomiter,” palpable olive-like mass 4:1 M:F. Classically presents in 3-6wo infants, but can worsen by 2-3 mos (rare by 12wo). 11.12.1.2 Pathophysiology Hypertrophy of pylorus. Risk factors = bottle feeding, maternal smoking. 11.12.1.3 Work-up BMP (hyperchloremic metabolic alkalosis), CBC (should be wnl), bili (unconjugated hyperbili), hemoccult stool (should be neg), abd US 11.12.1.4 Management Address dehydration and correct alkalosis Consult Surgery for pyloromyotomy (definitive treatment) Post-op feeding can start within hours 11.12.2 Malrotation/Volvulus 11.12.2.1 Presentation Bilious emesis, third spacing, HD instability 11.12.2.2 Pathophysiology Malro: Arrest in normal rotation in embryonic gut. Misplaced cecum is attached by peritoneal bands (Ladd bands) which cross the duodenum, leading to risk of volvulus. Mostly asymptomatic. Volvulus: Small bowel twisting around SMA → vascular compromise, ischemia, necrosis 11.12.2.3 Work-up Depends on clinical stability Bilious emesis + signs of sepsis/HD compromise + suspicion for volvulus → rapid resuscitation and surgical exploration If HD stable → KUB, upper GI series (corkscrew appearance), abd US (whirlpool sign), CT in adults. Laproscopy if indeterminate. 11.12.2.4 Management Ladd procedure: Division of Ladd bands, widening mesenteric base, explore duodenum with tube for patency, appendectomy (to avoid future confusion w/ abd pain), bowel resection PRN, replacement of bowels in nonrotation Post-op, address short gut syndrome if relevant 11.12.3 Biliary Atresia (BA) 11.12.3.1 Presentation Jaundice, acholic stools, hepatomegaly 11.12.3.2 Pathophysiology Most common cause of neonatal cholestasis; more common in premature infants Grouped into 3 categories: Nonsyndromic type: Most common type (84%). Perinatal and involves an inflammatory process involving intra- and extrahepatic fibro-obliteration → direct hyperbili → biliary cirrhosis, liver failure. Etiology unknown although possibly virus &amp; toxins. Biliary Atresia Splenic Malformation (10% of cases) is associated w/ laterality malformations (e.g. situs inversus, asplenia/polysplenia, malrotation, interrupted IVC, cardiac anomalies) 3rd type (6% of cases) is associated w/ other congenital anomalies (e.g. intestinal atresia, imperforate anus, kidney and cardiac anomalies) 11.12.3.3 Work-up Labs: Bilirubin (conjugated hyperbili &gt;1.0 mg/dl is always considered pathological and warrants workup), liver enzymes (transaminitis, elevated GGTP), obtain TSH/T4 for ddx Imaging: Abd US (inability to visualize gallbladder or small gallbladder), HIDA scan (looks for excretion of bile from liver) Operative: Liver biopsy, intra-op cholangiogram 11.12.3.4 Management 100% mortality by 2yo if untreated. Early diagnosis (&lt; 8wo) improves prognosis. Kasai procedure (hepatoportoenterostomy): Best if done before 2mo. Removal of portal tract remnant followed by Roux-en-Y anastomosis of jejunal loop directly to liver capsule to allow bile drainage. 60-70% of patients undergoing Kasai will eventually need liver transplant (BA = most common indication for pediatric liver transplant) 11.13 GI Imaging 11.13.1 Abdominal XR (KUB) 11.13.1.1 Description Radiography. Positions: PA upright (most common), left lateral decubitus (for closer evaluation of peritoneal free air or to look for air trapping) 11.13.1.2 Used to Evaluate Abdominal pain or distension, constipation, emesis, concern for mass, concern for ingestion 11.13.1.3 Potential Pathology Visualized Constipation (stool burden) Ileus, bowel obstruction (dilated loops of bowel) Foreign body Necrotizing enterocolitis, bowel ischemia (pneumatosis, pneumoperitoneum, air in the biliary tree) Bowel perforation (free air under diaphragm) 11.13.1.4 Patient Prep None 11.13.2 Modified Barium Swallow (MBS) 11.13.2.1 Description Videofluorography to evaluate the function of the phases of swallowing.

Both IV and oral contrast can be used. 11.13.4.2 Used to Evaluate Colicky pain; abd trauma (once HDS stable); cancer; liver disease; features of small intestinal Crohn’s disease (fistula, stricture, abscess) 11.13.4.3 Potential Pathology Visualized Nephrolithiasis, urinary tract calculi (non-con); pelvic or abdo masses (contrast); IBD; SBO/LBO; diffuse liver disease (steatosis, iron deposition disease, cirrhosis); appendicitis; abd trauma 11.13.4.4 Patient Prep Oral or IV contrast as indicated 11.13.5 Contrast Enema 11.13.5.1 Description Contrast agent per rectum: Water-soluble (gastrograffin) if bowel perforation suspected, air if intussusception suspected 11.13.5.2 Used to Evaluate IBD; SBO/LBO; intussusception; anastomotic stricture or abnormality in post-surgical short bowel syndrome 11.13.5.3 Potential Pathology Visualized Lower abd obstruction in the neonate (Hirshprung’s, meconium ileus, ileal atresia); intussusception (diagnostic and therapeutic); dnastomotic abnormality 11.13.5.4 Patient Prep None 11.14 G-Tubes &amp; J-Tubes 11.14.1 PowerPlans, Order Sets &amp; Clinical Pathways PowerPlans &amp; Order Sets: Enteral Tube Obstruction Plan (can also find under Gastrostomy Tube Obstruction Plan) 11.14.2 Indications Inadequate intake (lower threshold in already malnourished, premature, oncologic kids) NG/NJ = 1st line, short-term; GT/GJ/JT = if feedings indicated &gt; 2 months 11.14.3 Tube Troubleshooting Before calling for help, need to know: what kind of tube (type, size), who placed it (Surgery, GI, IR), and how old is the original tract? 11.14.3.1 Tube Falls Out NEW T-type PEG tubes placed by GI/Surgery &lt; 6 months ago: Do not attempt replacement! Page GI fellow as tube will likely need replacement by IR. Surgically-placed G-tube: If tract is &lt; 12 wks old, page Gen Surg. If &gt; 12 wks old, replace immediately with same-sized tube. If new tube is not immediately available, use Foley catheter in same French size (or 1 size larger to help dilate the tract). Do not force the tube in, as this can lead to false-tracking. Obtain G-tube study if any concerns for tube malposition. 11.14.3.2 Clogged Tube Crush 1 tab of sodium bicarb (324 mg) and 1 tab of Viokase 8 (Pancrelipase) in 5mL water. Instill slurry into feeding tube; wait 30-60 min, withdraw, and flush. See Enteral/Gastrostomy Tube Obstruction Order Set. 11.14.3.3 Granulation Tissue Stabilize tube. Consider silver nitrate vs. triamcinolone cream vs. salt in small amount of water. 11.14.3.4 Contact Dermatitis Absorbent topical powder, dressing. Consider Aveeno, Dombro, topical antifungal. 11.14.3.5 Cellulitis Outline erythema and start antibiotics 11.14.4 Devices 11.14.4.1 Percutaneous Endoscopic Gastrostomy (PEG) Tube Usually T-type tube w/ cross-bar to hold internal balloon tight to abdominal wall Needs 6 months before conversion to skin-level device. This is done endoscopically with sedation. 11.14.4.2 Surgically Placed G-Tube MIC-G: Non-skin level device w/ 3 ports (feeds, meds, balloon). Has round disk flange to hold it to abdominal wall. MIC-KEY: Skin level button device w/ 2 ports. Tubing swivels, allowing patient to move comfortably. Now using AMT tubes instead of MIC-KEY. Bard button: Skin level device, slightly smaller than MIC-KEY. Uses plastic bolster rather than balloon. MIC-GJ: Non-skin level device placed by IR through existing gastrostomy site. Has separate ports for gastric and jejunal. MIC-KEY-GJ: Skin level button device w/ separate ports for gastric and jejunal. Multiple jejunal exit holes allow for decreased clogging. 11.14.4.3 Jejunal Tube No bolus feeds; continuous only, and requires slow advances Needs large water flushes (15-30 mL) after medications and feeds to prevent clogging Crushed medications can precipitate and should not be given through the J tube (e.g. ciprofloxacin) If vomiting, look for intussusception around tube with tube study 11.15 Infant Formulas See the “Pediatric Formula Guide” on the BCRP website’s Virtual White Coat for more detailed information 11.15.1 Helpful Math 1 oz = ~30 mL Standard infant formula = 20 kcal/oz. Toddler/infant formula (1yo+) = 30kcal/oz 11.15.2 Types of Formula 11.15.2.1 Cow’s Milk Common brands: Enfamil (cheapest); Similac Advance (claims to have better calcium absorption); “Step 2” or “next step” versions (babies &gt; 6mo) have more calcium, protein; Preemie versions (Enfacare, Neosure) have 22 kcal/oz, extra calcium, phosphorus 11.15.2.2 Partially Hydrolyzed Whey = cow’s milk-based Common brands: Good Start (made by Nestle, covered by WIC) 11.15.2.3 Soy Lactose-free, good for lactose intolerance or galactosemia Can cause constipation Common brands: Prosobee (made by Enfamil); Isomil (made by Similac); Goodstart Soy 11.15.2.4 Hydrolyzed, Semi-Elemental Common brands: Nutramigen (cheapest, covered by WIC); Alimentum (sweeter taste); Pregestimil 11.15.2.5 Amino Acid-Based, Elemental Very expensive $$$$ Common brands: Neocate (covered by WIC); Elecare (higher MCT oil content, less osms) 11.15.3 Caloric Supplements Formulas can be safely concentrated up to 28 kcal/oz If increased renal solute load is undesirable, use carb/lipid caloric supplements instead: Polycose powder (carb-based) Corn oil, medium chain triglyceride (MCT) oil (lipid-based) Duocal (contains both carb and fats, only for infants &gt; 1yo) 11.16 Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) NOTE: Enteral feeding is always the preferred route of nutrition support! It ↓ gut atrophy, ↓ infections (boosts gut immune function), ↓ liver damage, and ↓ source of infection from central line. 11.16.1 PowerPlans, Order Sets &amp; Clinical Pathways PowerPlans &amp; Order Sets: PN + lipid Orderset, PN Monitoring Plan, PN Profile At BCH you write your own PN orders, but Nutrition will always walk you through it step by step! 11.16.2 Indications Low birth weight. Abnormal nutritional status (z-score &lt; -2 weight-for-age or weight-for-height, &lt; 2500g). Dysfunctional GI tract. NPO &gt; 4 days.

Vit K for coagulopathy Entecavir, tenofovir, peginterferon alfa-2a, IFNa (20-50% will seroconvert, but lots of systemic side effects), lamivudine (high rate of resistance) Direct-acting antiretrovirals (DAA), specific treatment depends on genotype and age (ledipasvir/sofosbuvir, sofosbuvir/ribavirin or Glecaprevir/Piprentasvir). Treatment for patients &lt; 3 yo should be deferred (until Ribavirin-free DAA available). IFN-based. Lamivudine is not helpful. Prognosis Usually self-limiting - Self-limited or progression to chronic HBV/carrier status (esp. neonates)- Cirrhosis in 3%- Increased risk of hepatocellular cancer (yearly RUQ US, AFP level) - 20-45% spontaneous clearance- Remainder will have slow progression to cirrhosis/hepatocellular cancer if untreated Worse prognosis and faster progression than HBV alone 11.18.1 Hep B Serologies HBsAg (surface antigen): Indicative of acute infection, disappears in 3-6 mos HBsAg for &gt;6 mos: Carrier state HBeAg (secretory protein) and HBV DNA by PCR suggest active viral replication Anti-HBc IgM (antibody to core protein): Secondary indicator of acute infection HBsAb (antibody to surface protein): Neutralizing antibody, suggests recovery or response to HBV vaccine 11.18.1.1 Timeline of Hep B Serologies 11.18.1.2 Interpretation of Hep B Serologies Anti-HBc IgM Anti-HBc IgG HBsAg Anti-HBs Interpretation POS Neg POS Neg Acute HBV infxn Neg Neg POS Neg Early acute HBV infxn Neg POS Neg POS Resolved acute HBV infxn Neg Neg Neg POS Prior vaccination for HBV (NOT infected) Neg Neg Neg Neg Not infected Neg POS POS Neg Chronic HBV infxn 11.19 Autoimmune Hepatitis 11.19.1 Presentation Acute vs. subacute.

Typically 10-20yo, affects mostly (75%) females 11.19.2 Pathophysiology Type 1 (classic, 80% of cases): +ANA, anti-SM and/or anti-nuclear, anti-actin, rarely anti-ASGPR Type 2: Anti-LKM and/or anti-liver cytosol. Recurrence and fulminant hepatitis more common in Type 2. In AIH associated w/ Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia, none of the typical autoantibodies are present 11.19.3 Work-up LFTs, Ig levels, auto-antibodies, coags, consider liver biopsy. Sero-negative AIH exist but are rare. Cholangiography if cholestatic w/ c/f “Overlap Syndrome” with PSC 11.19.4 Management Prednisone (18-24m) or azathioprine/6-MP (steroid-sparing; check TPMT enzyme activity first, as low TMPT levels = risk of myelosuppression) Monitor LFTs for treatment success Relapse more common if tx weaned in first 3 yrs of therapy or during puberty 11.20 Non-Alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD) 11.20.1 Presentation Often asymptomatic. Fatigue, abdominal discomfort, acanthosis nigricans. 11.20.2 Pathophysiology Incompletely understood, but insulin-resistance considered a key mechanism, +/- oxidative injury 11.20.3 Work-up Screen if &gt; 9yo and BMI &gt;94%, or &gt;85% + risk factor (e.g. signs of insulin resistance) ALT &gt;&gt;&gt; AST, alk phos, GGTP (although LFTs can be normal) Abd US, Fibroscan (to assess degree of fibrosis) Liver biopsy: If steatosis + hepatocellular injury present, then it is Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (NASH) 11.20.4 Management Diet and exercise counseling, bariatric surgery, consider Vitamin E (limited evidence) 11.21 References Lehman, et al., Transient focal neurologic symptoms correspond to regional cerebral hypoperfusion by MRI: A stroke mimic in children.

painful and swollen hands/feet Abdomen: Can mimic an acute abdomen Renal: Papillary necrosis → hyposthenuria (inability to concentrate urine) Lungs: Acute chest syndrome CNS: Cerebral infarction, hemorrhage (young adults), seizures, transient ischemic attacks, cranial nerve palsies, meningitis, sensory deficits, and acute coma Skin: Ulceration, especially over bony prominences (malleoli) Eye: Retinal hemorrhages, proliferative retinopathy (more common in HbSC) Penis: Prevents drainage of blood from the corpus cavernosum leading to priapism Acute chest syndrome (ACS): Pulmonary infarction → fever, cough, chest pain, SOB, new pulmonary infiltrate on x-ray Fever: Viral vs. bacterial (including encapsulated organisms: H. flu, S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis) Children w/ sickle cell anemia also have lower serum IgM levels, impaired opsonization, and sluggish alternative complement pathway activation, so are susceptible to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli Sepsis: Strep pneumo is most common cause Hyposplenia: Splenic autoinfarction → susceptible to infections w/ encapsulated bacteria Osteomyelitis: Staph &gt; Salmonella, treat w/ CTX/Vanc Aplastic crisis: Decreased retic/RBCs, parvo B19 infection, pallor, weakness, fatigue Splenic sequestration crisis: Marked decrease in hemoglobin level despite persistent reticulocytosis, splenic vasoocclusion → rapid splenomegaly, prior to autosplenectomy 12.2.0.3 Diagnosis VOE: Labs: CBCd (compare to baseline Hb), retics, chem10, LFTs, amylase/lipase, T&amp;S Imaging: CXR PA &amp; lateral for fever, chest wall pain, hypoxia, or respiratory symptoms Fever: Labs: CBCd (compare to baseline Hb), retics, chem10, LFTs, amylase/lipase, T&amp;S, BCx (for 1st temp &gt;38.5C or 101.3F) and qdaily w/ temp spikes, ABG if hypoxic Other studies: UA/UCx (cath all M &lt;6mo, F &lt;2yo, or any child w/ urinary sx), viral panel, throat culture (if suggestive on exam), stool studies (if having diarrhea), LP (if neurologic s/sx) Imaging: CXR PA &amp; lateral (if fever, chest wall pain, hypoxia, respiratory symptoms) 12.2.0.4 Management See sections below on VOE, ACS, and fever 12.2.1 Vaso-Occlusive Episode (VOE) BMC Sickle Cell Cards: NOTE practices may vary at BCH. Should not replace clinical judgment or Pedi Heme consult (place consult order in EPIC and page on-call pager 5731); please page daily after rounds to discuss management as needed, and read daily consult note for detailed recommendations. THE INFORMATION BELOW IS APPLICABLE TO BOTH BMC &amp; BCH: 12.2.1.1 Fluids, Monitoring, &amp; Labs Hydration: D5 1/2NS or D5 NS @ 1.25x maintenance is crucial to lessen sickling Continuous pulse oximetry Routine labs are not needed for uncomplicated VOE DVT prophylaxis should be addressed for all patients per inpatient protocol 12.2.1.1.1 Pain Management Non-opioid analgesics: Standing NSAID: Ketorolac on admission if proven benefit; after 72 hrs switch to standing ibuprofen q6h Additional modalities: Ketamine (refer to Lexicomp for dosage), hot packs, lidocaine patch, distraction, Child Life, relaxation, acupuncture Opioids: Management and prevention of opioid side effects: Constipation: Standing stimulant laxative (senna) and daily Miralax w/ admit. Titrate for 1 soft formed stool q1-2d. Escalate PRN, may add Mg citrate, milk of magnnesia, lactulose, methylnaltrexone. Pruritus and nausea: Start w/ camphor-menthol lotion for mild itching. Next step is a naloxone drip at 0.5 mcg/kg/h, titrate up to 2 mcg/kg/h q3-4h for significant itching/nausea. Can then add Zofran. Avoid Benadryl given the sedating effect. Prevent hypoventilation: Crucially important in preventing atelectasis and ACS! Incentive spirometer 10x/hr while awake and q4h overnight. Bubbles or pinwheel in younger kids. HOB elevated to 30 degrees at all times. Have patient sit up in bed, out of bed to chair, and ambulation as tolerated. Standing albuterol q4-6h for pt w/ asthma, history of wheeze w/ prior VOE, chest or back pain, or any current wheezing or cough. Oxygen overnight PRN (goal O2 sat &gt; 95% or pt’s known baseline; can provide NC O2 at 0.5-1L for mild desats while asleep; does not replace the need for incentive spirometry). Continue any home respiratory therapies (home O2, CPAP, etc). Titration of PCA/opioids: Use patient reported pain score (compare to baseline/chronic pain level) AND change in pain AND patient functional status to assess pain control Assess for VOE vs. opioid side effects to help w/ dose adjustment Reassess pain control frequently, especially during first 24 hrs, and adjust PCA as needed w/ goal of providing 2/3 of total opioid dose as basal and 1/3 as demand Consider increasing basal rate by 20% overnight early in the admission to avoid falling behind in pain control while asleep As pain is captured, wean PCA rate and then switch to orals Weaning to orals: Please discuss patient specific plan w/ Pedi Heme; details will depend on length of admission, pain tolerance, and patient preference. In general, when pain is well-controlled, replace the basal PCA w/ SCHEDULED long- or short-acting oral medication (MS Contin, oxycodone, or hydromorphone), leaving the PCA demand button. If pain remains well-controlled after 12-24 hrs, then replace PCA demand w/ a standing short-acting medication (often oxycodone, tramadol, or hydromorphone). This step should be considered both a conversion and a wean. Quick conversion from IV to oral opiates (meant as a guide, not a mandate): Total Basal IV morphine use over 24 hours Total Basal IV dilaudid use over 24 hours MSContin dose If using ONLY oxycodone 10mg 2.5mg 15mg PO q12 5mg PO q6 15mg 4mg 15mg PO q8 5mg PO q4 20mg 5mg 30mg PO q12 10mg PO q6 30mg 8mg 30mg PO q8 10mg PO q4 12.2.1.2 Discharge planning Ready for discharge when pain is controlled on oral meds (pain may not be gone at this time) Continue standing pain meds x48hrs at home before tapering to PRN Anticipate home opioid needs; ask if opioids are available at home, and prescribe meds-in-hand early on day of discharge. If patient prefers to fill meds at home pharmacy, provide Rx early in hospital course (controlled substance prescriptions can now be faxed or sent electronically). Be aware of specific MA prescribing requirements for opioids. Schedule follow-up in Heme clinic w/i 1 week (BMC clinic phone # 617-414-4841), appointments are available everyday Mon-Fri 12.2.2 Acute Chest Syndrome (ACS) ACS in SCD is multifactorial. Causes include infection, bronchospasm, inflammation, and fat embolization. It can be very serious and needs to be managed very closely. 12.2.2.1 Optimize ventilation to prevent serious sequelae from ACS: Incentive spirometry 10x per hour while awake and q4h overnight Have patient sitting up in bed, out of bed to chair, and ambulation as tolerated Examine patients for any drop in O2 saturation — do NOT simply put on oxygen w/o evaluating Standing albuterol neb q4-6h for those patients with known benefit, people with a history of reactive airway, asthma, wheeze on clinical exam. Add inhaled corticosteroid only if on one at home Consult Pulm for any patient w/ wheezing, severe ACS, or as needed to help optimize respiratory status; please notify Pulm when of their patients are admitted w/ ACS Consider high flow NC or BIPAP as appropriate (requires ICU transfer) 12.2.2.2 Fluid balance needs to be monitored carefully: Patients w/ SCD require increased IVF in cases of VOE or fever/dehydration. However, overhydration can worsen ACS. In general, use IV + PO at 1x maintenance for patients w/ ACS Must have strict I/O’s ordered and reviewed regularly to adjust fluids as needed 12.2.2.3 Other monitoring &amp; labs Continuous pulse oximetry All patients w/ ACS should have an active type &amp; screen DVT prophylaxis should be addressed for all patients per inpatient protocol 12.2.2.4 Antibiotics should include coverage for pneumococcus and atypicals (typically ceftriaxone and oral azithromycin): See Fever guidelines below for details 12.2.2.5 Transfusions must be approved by Heme: Need to balance need for immediate treatment w/ long term risks of alloimmunization If the patient does not have an O2 requirement, we typically attempt medical management w/ abx and aggressive pulmonary toilet for 24hrs before transfusing Potential indications for transfusion in ACS include a drop in Hb &gt; 2g/dL below baseline w/o appropriate reticulocytosis, a significant oxygen requirement, or worsening work of breathing See Blood Transfusions section below for details 12.2.2.6 Discharge planning Stable for discharge when BCx are negative x48hrs and respiratory status is stable/improved Should complete a full course of antibiotics to cover both pneumococcus and atypicals Schedule follow-up w/ PCP w/o the week and in Heme clinic preferably w/i a week (BMC clinic phone # 617-414-4841), appts at BMC are available every day Mon-Fri At BMC, please refer to Pulm for outpatient follow-up (referral for “SCD w/ ACS”) 12.2.3 Fever 12.2.3.1 Definition T &gt;38.5C (101.3F) if &gt;2mo 12.2.3.2 Work-up Detailed history and physical exam to identify potential source Labs: CBCd (compare to baseline Hb), retics, chem10, clot (hold for Blood Bank), BCx (for 1st temp &gt;38.5C (101.3F) and qdaily w/ temp spikes), ABG (if hypoxic) Other studies: UA/UCx (cath all M &lt;6mo, F &lt;2yo, or any child w/ urinary sx), viral panel, throat culture (if suggestive on exam), stool studies (if having diarrhea), LP (if neurologic s/sx) Imaging: CXR PA &amp; lateral (if fever, chest wall pain, hypoxia, respiratory symptoms) 12.2.3.3 Management Inpatient management: IV bolus of 10 - 20 ml/kg if dehydrated→ IV fluids @ 1.25 Maint (+/- for fluid intolerance vs. dehydration) Antibiotics: Goal administration w/i 30 min of arrival! Draw cultures first. Do not delay treatment while awaiting lab results and CXR. Needs empiric antibiotics even if a source of infection is identified. Ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg IV/IM q24h (max dose 1g/day), q12h (max 2g/day) if suspect meningitis. If allergic to Ceftriaxone, consider Levofloxacin or Clindamycin if inpatient. Add Vancomycin 40-60 mg/kg/day divided q6h for CNS involvement (including meningitis), septic shock, central line/port, or hx of resistant infection For HD instability or meningitis; consider in pts w/ port or hx of resistant infection Add Azithromycin PO for pts w/ positive CXR or respiratory symptoms Outpatient management and follow-up: Observe in ED for 2 hrs after giving CTX. Return if: Temp &gt;38.5C; poor PO intake; lethargy; respiratory symptoms; pain. Follow up in Hematology clinic, PCP’s office, or ED in 24 hours for re-evaluation &amp; 2nd dose of CTX Follow up BCx at 24 and 48 hrs → call PCP regarding ED visit &amp; to assure follow up 12.2.4 Blood Transfusions in SCD Blood transfusions in SCD are used to increase RBC mass and oxygen carrying capacity and to decrease proportion of sickle cells. Acute benefits of transfusion must be weighed against the long-term risks, including alloimmunization. Phenotypically matched (ABO, Rh-D, Kell, C, E), sickle negative, leuko-depleted irradiated packed red blood cells are the blood product of choice. More extensive phenotyping needed for patients on chronic transfusion. It may take hours for the blood bank to find matched blood, and even longer in cases of alloimmunization so maintain an active type and screen if you anticipate needing to transfuse a patient. 12.2.4.1 Potential indications for transfusion Aplastic crisis/acute anemia (drop in Hb &gt; 2g/dL below baseline) w/o an appropriate reticulocytosis Acute chest syndrome (ACS) not responsive to medical management or severe disease/ hypoxemia Symptomatic anemia Pre-procedure prophylaxis (goal Hb of 10 g/dL) Splenic sequestration: Hb drop &gt; 2g/dl, drop in platelet count and WBC as well Monitor spleen size and labs frequently 12.2.4.2 Amount of blood to transfuse based on goal Hb: mL of pRBC = (desired Hb - current Hb) x (wt (kg) x Blood Vol(ml/kg)) /(Hb of PRBC) Blood volume = 80mL/kg for children Hb of pRBCs = 18.5g/dL at BMC, avg HCT 60% at BCH 1 unit pRBC = 250-350 mL; consider rounding down to a whole unit to avoid extra donor exposure 12.2.4.3 Other considerations Premedicate only if history of transfusion reaction Need for post-transfusions labs to be dictated by individual case 12.3 Transfusion Medicine 12.3.1 Consenting a Patient for Blood Products 12.3.1.1 Risks Fever, chills, hives/itching, and shortness of breath (can be managed w/ medications) Hemolytic transfusion reaction or transfusion-related lung injury (rare) Bacterial or viral infection (hepatitis C, hepatitis B, HIV, malaria).

ABCs: address any need for airway protection, intubation, mechanical ventilation, rehydration, inotropic support Identify the trigger: underlying illness vs dehydration vs incorrect diet - will help metabolism guide management Consider alternate dx: electrolyte imbalance, sepsis Established dx: acute illness protocols above, family should have home / ED illness protocol Bill’s Pearls: Think about the underlying metabolic state of the patient! The catabolic state precipitates most problems in decompensating metabolic diseases, anabolic support is focused on giving calories to stimulate insulin secretion and signaling. If someone is really sick and they are hyperglycemic (BG &gt; 250 mg/dL), it would be better to give insulin than to cut the dextrose because the insulin will increase the anabolic support. If you have elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate (blood) or acetoacetate(urine) then you are in a catabolic state and at risk. Similarly, don’t be falsely reassured by correcting lab values. For instance, you can easily correct hypoglycemia, but the patient could still be catabolic and/or depleted of stores from their illness. They may still decompensate rapidly after therapy is weaned off. 14.2.2 Acute Metabolic Encephalopathy 14.2.2.1 Definition Acute global cerebral dysfunction → altered mentation w/ or w/o seizures NOT due to primary structural brain disease (e.g., tumor or hemorrhage) or infection (though some IEMs may cause strokes) 14.2.2.2 Etiologies Hyperammonemia, metabolic acidosis-hyperlactatemia or ketosis, hypoglycemia, recurrent seizures (‘excitotoxic’ damage), specific toxins, e.g., copper deposition in Wilson’s, electrolyte imbalances 14.2.2.3 Presentation May be precipitated by high protein intake, catabolic state (fever/illness/GIB/fast) Presents w/ lethargy, AMS, seizures, tachypnea 2/2 metabolic acidosis or central stimulation by inc NH3 Do NOT rule out IEMs even if: functional neuro disorder, presentation @ older age, sudden onset, no PMHx 14.2.2.4 Management Reverse catabolism ASAP and prevent sequelae, do frequent neuro checks Hydration: 10 mL/kg NS bolus if dehydrated, then D10 NS + 20 mEq/L of KCl (add after ruling out hyperkalemia or after voiding) @ 1-1.5x M, avoid hyponatremia (predisposes to cerebral edema; minimum of 4-5 meq/kg/day of sodium in fluids) Nutrition: give calories via carbs + IL alone (unless FA ox d/o is on ddx, then no IL) to provide 1-1.5x TEE (120-150 kcal/kg/day), preferably enteral nutrition (enteral carbs → portal vein → maximize insulin release); can give TPN if enteral feeds are not tolerated, start protein w/in 48h Promote anabolism: nutrition, ↓ counter-regulatory hormones → ensure adequate volume, ondansetron for vomiting if not at risk of long QT, treat infxn/fever/pain, correct hypoglycemia (bolus of 2 or 5 mL of 25 or 10% Dextrose → rule of 50 (i.e., vol*%dex = 50), then infusion to maintain a GIR of 8-12 mg/kg/min [GIR in mg/kg/min = dextrose% x Vol (ml/kg/day) / 144]), maintain normoglycemia if needed with insulin @ 0.1mcg/kg/hr, titrating to maintain glucose between 100-120mg/dL (goal of high GIR = get glucose (i.e., calories), into the cells rather than add to Sosm by causing hyperglycemia), wean GIR slowly to prevent rebound hypoglycemia Cofactor therapy: try the vitamins below even empirically, but esp if these disorders are on ddx Suspected Enzyme Deficiency Cofactor Propionyl-CoA carboxylase, Beta-methylcrotonyl-CoA carboxylase, Holocarboxylase synthase, Pyruvate carboxylase, Biotinidase deficiency Biotin (dose depends on disorder) Methylmalonyl-CoA mutase Hydroxycobalamin 1 mg/day IM BCAA DH (MSUD), Pyruvate DH, Alpha-ketoglutarate DH Thiamine (B1) 100 mg/day GAII (Multiple acyl-CoA DH) Riboflavin (B2) 200 mg/day L-carnitine: inc urinary excretion of carnitine-bound organic acids → secondary deficiency; carnitine is neuroprotective and non-toxic, give 100mg/kg/day, max 6 g/d, 1st via IV bolus of daily dose, then divide q4-6h, IV or enteral; carnitine controversial in FAOD Toxin removal: CVVH ideal; can consider PLEX or peritoneal dialysis in neonates (less effective); extracorporeal toxin removal if severe Specific rx: Address underlying acidosis, hyperammonemia (scavengers), metabolic pathway block 14.2.2.5 Risks of therapy Overhydration cerebral edema / herniation (may need ventilation + other modes to control ICP while maintaining cerebral perfusion w/ mannitol, hypothermia) protein malnutrition (if no protein &gt;48h) 14.2.3 Hyperammonemia PowerPlan: Metabolism Hyperammonemia Admit Orderset 14.2.3.1 Definition Normal ammonia levels vary w/ prematurity, age, and catabolic state; usu 15-35 μmol/L (up to 100 μmol/L in neonates), nl &lt;50 μmol/L.

Glycogen stores are typically depleted (no response from glucagon) 14.2.6.3 Presentation Very common in children 16 months to 3 years, usually gone by ages 10-12. Possibly related to factors that improve with age (increased muscle mass, decreasing GIR need, decreased head to body size). 14.2.6.4 Physical exam Look for skin darkening or other signs of adrenocortical insufficiency Enlarged liver (Hepatic glycogen storage disease) 14.2.6.5 Management Promote anabolic state (not just correct the blood glucose) Start children on D10 containing fluids at 1.5x maintenance rate until they demonstrate the ability to take substantial calories by mouth Do not discharge catabolic state reversed (e.g. taking very good PO, ketones clearing, hepatic stores repleting) 14.2.7 Access in a metabolic crisis Pay attention to access because it determines your ability to provide anabolic support and give scavengers.

Urine pH &gt;5 in setting of acidosis suggests distal RTA. Urine (non-glucose) reducing substances Suggestive of galactosuria or fructosuria Urine ketones (if acidosis or hypoglycemia) As with plasma ketoacids, although B-OHB may be easier to obtain from plasma in infants 14.3.1.5 Secondary workup In discussion with metabolism: Urine: Organic acids, acylglycines, mucopolysaccharides, oligosaccharides Plasma: AAs (quantitative), carnitine + acylcarnitine, Peroxisomal tests (VLCFA), bile acid analysis CSF: for amino acids (glycine), lactate, pyruvate, and neurotransmitters, glucose (with corresponding serum glucose 30 min before LP) Imaging: Brain MRI/MRS, HIDA scan for biliary atresia Auditory + ophthalmologic evaluations *In general pre-prandial samples should be sent for most tests (at least 2-4 hours after last feed) Bill’s Pearls: Plasma AAs A plasma amino acid panel can tell you if you need to give protein or not, if you see deficiency in multiple amino acids. You can only restrict protein for 24-48 hours before an amino acid deficiency develops. When there is an AA deficiency, the catabolic state is less responsive to dextrose-based anabolic support. In addition to protein synthesis, amino acids have other synthetic and regulatory roles (methionine -&gt; methylation of DNA, synthesis of creatine; leucine -&gt; stimulator of insulin secretion; cysteine -&gt; antioxidant; etc.) you may not otherwise think about. 14.3.2 Later onset About 50% of patients with IEMs present beyond the immediate neonatal period (even as adults!) 14.3.2.1 History Episodic illness precipitated by mild intercurrent illness, fasting, or change of diet, specific dietary preferences (e.g., autovegetarianism seen in conditions predisposing to hyperammonemia), behavioral issues such as ADHD (partially treated PKU) 14.3.2.2 Presentation Can be classified into 2 patterns which may overlap: Acute, presenting in a metabolic crisis w/ emesis, lethargy, seizures, tachypnea Encephalopathy Without focal findings: look for predominant acidosis, hyperammonemia or hypoglycemia &amp; work up as outlined above With focal findings: homocystinuria with thromboembolic event, mitochondrial disorders with CVA, biotin-responsive basal ganglia disease, some OA (striatal necrosis inorganic acidemias); cerebral edema in UCDs Recurrent ataxia: MSUD, OTC, pyruvate dehydrogenase (associated peripheral neuropathy) Psychiatric symptoms: UCD’s, porphyrias, homocystinuria, cobalamin C disease, late-onset Tay Sachs Dehydration associated with: Polyuria: RTA, nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus Diarrhea: glucose or galactose malabsorption, acrodermatitis enteropathica (Zn deficiency), sucrase isomaltase deficiency, congenital chloride diarrhea Ketoacidosis: MMA, IVA, PA, DM Salt losing: CAH, hypoaldosteronism Reye syndrome-like: UCD’s and OA’s, disorders of mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation and ketogenesis Indolent: FTT, myopathies, neurological sequelae (DD, ID, micro/microcephaly), dysmorphisms 14.4 Aminoacidopathies Bill’s Pearls: high-level approach to Aminoacidopathies Amino acid concentrations that get excessively elevated can cause cerebral edema (e.g. leucine in MSUD, methionine in homocystinuria). Avoid excessive fluid administration if you think these states are present. The key is to provide metabolic formula that has caloric value and a mixture of amino acids that don’t include the toxic ones (i.e. branched-chain-free formula in MSUD). The goal is to make the toxic amino acid the limiting reagent in protein synthesis and to provide enough calories to stimulate protein synthesis. You don’t get the same effect with dextrose-containing fluids and end up giving more volume. PowerPlan if relevant: Metabolism MSUD Admit Orderset 14.4.0.1 Biochemical defect Defect in AA metabolism → toxic AA metabolites accumulate 14.4.0.2 Presentation May present early (neonatal period) as catastrophic ‘intoxication’-like disease → feeding difficulty, lethargy, tachypnea, and poor perfusion → encephalopathy (e.g., MSUD) May present later w/ chronic encephalopathy (e.g., PKU) Often NO acidosis or hyperammonemia (vs organic acidemias and UCDs) 14.4.0.3 Workup Definitive: quant plasma AAs + sequencing May be suggested by NBS, labs w/ hypoglycemia, ketosis, liver dysfxn 14.4.0.4 Management (general approach) Restrict culprit AA in diet, monitor plasma AAs carefully Avoid catabolism: may be with dextrose-containing fluids and/or AA-excluding formulas (encourage new protein synthesis with toxic AA as limiting reagent) Cofactor therapy in some cases Disorder Enzyme Blockade Accumulated Substrate(s) Presentation Treatment Phenylketonuria Phenylalanine hydroxylase (Phe → Tyr) Phenylalanine Neurotoxicity, intellectual deficits, microcephaly, GDD, eczema Avoid Phe, give special Phe-free diet, consider cofactor tx (sapropterin), enzyme substitution (adults) Maple Syrup Urine Disease Branched-chain alpha-keto acid dehydrogenase BCAAs: Leu, Ile, Val, Leu is neurotoxic, causes hypoNa Catabolic stress, high Leu intake → HA, confusion, halluc, lethargy, N/V → coma/death Stop all Leu, give Leu-free feeds, dex-containing IVF, AVOID hypotonic fluids (cerebral edema) Homocystinuria Cystathionine β-synthase (Hcy → cystathionone) Homocysteine (chronic toxicity), Methionine (potentially acute cerebral edema) Intellectual disability, tall stature, thrombosis (Hcy is thrombophilic), downward lens dislocation, osteoporosis Met-free formula, B6 (cofactor for cystathionine β-synthase) in responsive patients, betaine (Hcy → Met), risk of cerebral edema with rapid methionine correction Tyrosinemia Fumaryl- acetoacetase (fumaroaceto-acetate, → fumarate + acetoacetate) Tyrosine (blood), Succinylacetone (urine) Liver failure, RTA - due to accumulation of succinylacetone Nitisinone (blocks early step in Tyr metab - can’t make succinylacetone), Tyr restriction 14.5 Carbohydrate Metabolism Defects PowerPlan if relevant: Galactosemia Admit Orderset 14.5.0.1 Biochemical defect Issues with glucose/fructose/galactose metabolism 14.5.0.2 Presentation Timing depends on intro to culprit carb (galactosemia early d/t breastmilk, fructose introduced later) and from timing of spacing feeds (longer fasting = need to mobilize glycogen stores → GSD becomes manifest) Often p/w metabolic crises (lethargy, encephalopathy, HD instability); may have stigmata of toxic deposition (see chart below) 14.5.0.3 Workup NBS: Galactosemia (NOT hereditary fructosuria or GSD) Definitive with enzyme assays from blood (also done on cultured fibroblasts &amp; liver) Suggestive labs: hypoglycemia, ketosis, metabolic acidosis, liver dysfunction; reducing substances in urine present in galactosemia + hereditary fructose intolerance 14.5.0.4 Management (general approach) Dietary avoidance of the given carbohydrate Some hepatic glycogen storage diseases are associated with hypoglycemia (I, III, IV, IX, 0). For sick children that need dextrose-containing fluids, the goal is to keep BG &gt; 77 but below 110. In excess of that, glycogen starts to be stored and can worsen existing accumulation. Disorder Enzyme Blockade Accumulated Substrate(s) Presentation Treatment Classic Galactosemia Galactose-1- phosphate uridyl transferase (allows for transfer of Gal-1-P to Glu-1-P) Gal-1-P, total galactose + urine reducing substances Hepatomegaly, jaundice, vomiting, cataracts, FTT, lethargy, proximal RTA (Fanconi syndrome), E Coli sepsis after starting galactose-containing feeds (e.g., breastmilk) No galactose - includes no lactose (milk / dairy) Hereditary Fructose Intolerance Aldolase B (splits F-1-P into DHAP + glyceraldehyde) F-1-P - urine reducing substances Similar to classic galactosemia, but no cataracts; occurs w/ fructose-containing foods No fructose from diet - includes no sucrose or sorbitol Glycogen Storage Disease (GSD) Type Ia (von Gierke) Glucose 6 phosphatase (G6P → glucose + Pi, last step of glycogen breakdown) G6P → lactate, triglycerides, and uric acid ~3-6 months: hypoglycemia 3-4 hrs after meal, lactic acidosis, hepatomegaly, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperuricemia, “doll face,” small size Frequent meals, Uncooked cornstarch 1.5-2.5 g/kg PO q4-6h, avoid sucrose/fructose/galactose, NaHCO3 for acidosis, allopurinol for hyperuricemia GSD Type IIa (Pompe) Lysosomal acid α-glucosidase Glycogen - accumulates in skeletal and cardiac muscles Progressive hypotonia, macroglossia, loss of motor, respiratory, and cardiac functions (cardiomyopathy).

Disorders occur d/t decreased carnitine uptake by cells (required for FA transport into the mitochondria), inhibiting entry of FAs into mitochondria, or by blocking β-oxidation. End result = energy-deficient state without appropriate ketosis. 14.6.0.2 Presentation Fasting-induced vomiting, lethargy, coma, and hypoglycemic seizures, occasional hepatomegaly (may be Reye’s-like) 14.6.0.3 Workup Suggested by hypoketotic hypoglycemia +/- liver failure, acidosis &amp; hyperammonemia.

On NBS in most states, but may present on DOL 2-3 Avoid fasting during illnesses, give dex-containing IVF if unable to tolerate PO, carnitine supplementation if low carnitine, AVOID MCT Long-chain / Very long-chain acyl-CoA DH deficiency LCHAD/VLCAD LCHAD/TFP: 3-hydroxy-acyl-carnitines (C16-OH) VLCAD: unsat long-chain acylcarnitines (C14:1) More severe than MCAD – rhabdo, CMP, liver failure, and HKHG even w/ rx. LCHAD may have peripheral neuropathy + retinopathy. On NBS in all states Dietary fat restriction, MCT oil supplementation, avoid fasting; give dex-containing IVF, Serial cardiac evaluations, check CK with illnesses Primary Carnitine Deficiency Defective carnitine transporter (OCTN2) – dec GI absorption / renal reabs. Elevated urine carnitine, low blood carnitine CMP + recurrent HKHG, may progress to Reye-like picture. Blood: low free carnitine. Urine: elevated carnitine excretion High-dose oral carnitine, avoidance of fasting, dex-containing IVF if unable to tolerate PO 14.7 Lysosomal Diseases 14.7.0.1 Biochemical defect Deficiency in lysosomal enzyme → excess intracellular substrate (e.g., GAGs, MPS) 14.7.0.2 Presentation Substrate build-up → HSM, coarse facies, short stature, skeletal abnormalities If nervous system involvement → intellectual disability, cataracts, neuropathy 14.7.0.3 Workup Enzyme assay on samples of WBCs, serum, or skin fibroblasts Disorder Enzyme Blockade Accumulated Substrate(s) Presentation Treatment Gaucher Disease β-glucosidase (glucocerebrosidase) Glucocerebroside Type 1:HSM, bone disease, anemia &amp; thrombocytopenia, absence of CNS disease Type 2&amp;3: Primarily neurologic with DD, regression, early death ERT, substrate reduction therapy Tay-Sachs Disease Hexosaminidase A GM2 gangliosides By age 1 - DD, exaggerated startle, sz, macular cherry-red spot Supportive Niemann-Pick Disease Sphingomyelinase Sphingomyelin Massive HSM, cherry red spot, interstitial lung disease; neuronopathic or non-neuronopathic HSCT for non- neuronopathic Krabbe Disease Galactocerebrosidase Galactocerebroside Infantile-onset:By age 1 - irritability, rapid neurologic deterioration,early childhood death.

Similar to MPSI r w/o corneal clouding. ERT, HSCT ERT = enzyme-replacement therapy. HSCT = hematopoietic stem-cell transplant. Autosomal recessive unless otherwise specified 14.8 Mitochondrial Disorders / Primary Lactic Acidemias Bill’s Pearls: high-level approach to Mitochondrial disorders Mitochondrial diseases don’t decompensate acutely like small molecule metabolic diseases. Therapy is focused on decreasing systemic stressors (treat infection, stop catabolism, correct dehydration, etc). Try to keep the bicarbonate &gt; 16, otherwise acidemia will impair mitochondrial function. The lactate levels will be what they are – just keep the bicarbonate up and don’t give too much dextrose (D5 ok, D10 negotiable). Don’t give valproic acid or Lactated Ringers. Lactate gets the attention but cardiac dysfunction in acute scenarios is the concern. Cardiac cells that have poor mitochondrial function typically hypertrophy, leading to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and some preload dependence. You are never wrong to get an EKG and call cardiology. Correct dehydration to minimize perfusion-associated lactic acidemia. If you think someone may have a mitochondrial disease, get a plasma amino acid level with a lactate. Look for elevated alanine as well, because of the high error associated with lactate due to blood draws. True metabolic acidemia should have an anion gap and acidic urine. 14.8.0.1 Biochemical defect Disorders of Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation; transmission via mitochondrial genes → defects vary / not all organs are affected equally 14.8.0.2 Presentation Indolent, progressive neurologic deterioration, +/- poor feeding, vomiting, CMP, myopathy, liver failure, seizures, strokes, blindness, deafness, and nephropathy 14.8.0.3 Workup Definitive dx from enzyme assay or DNA testing Labs often show AG metabolic acidosis and primary lactic acidosis +/- hypoglycemia w/ ketosis, liver dysfxn Disorder Enzyme Blockade Accumulated Substrate(s) Presentation Treatment Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex Deficiency Pyruvate dehydrogenase (Pyruvate → Acetyl CoA + CO2) Pyruvate → lactate Lactic acidosis, intellectual disability, hypotonia, seizures, exacerbated by ingestion of carbohydrates Supplement with carnitine, thiamine, and lipoic acid (cofactors for pyruvate DH complex), high fat / low carb diet or ketogenic diet Pyruvate Carboxylase Deficiency Pyruvate carboxylase (pyruvate + CO2 → oxaloacetate) Pyruvate → lactate NH3 (as Asp cannot be formed from OAA) Severe lactic acidosis, hypothermia, hypotonia, hypoglycemia, hyperammonemia, lethargy, vomiting, often death as neonate or w/in 1 year for Type B; Types A &amp; C are milder High carb and protein diet; Treat metabolic crisis with 10% dex-containing IVF, avoid fasting, NaHCO3 for acidosis, possible liver transplant 14.9 Organic Acidemias Powerplans if relevant: Metabolism IVA, MMA, PA, Glutaric Acidemia Type I Admit Ordersets 14.9.0.1 Biochemical defect Defect in AA breakdown → accumulation of organic acid byproducts 14.9.0.2 Presentation Neonatal lethargy, poor perfusion, vomiting, coma, CVAs, death 14.9.0.3 Workup Definitive: quant plasma AAs Often on NBS (elevated C3 / C5 acylcarnitines) Usually p/w severe high AG metabolic acidosis, +/- hyperammonemia, hypoglycemia, liver dysfunction, ketosis, and secondary carnitine deficiency 14.9.0.4 Management (general approach) Stop all protein intake, high-dose carnitine, promote anabolism with D10NS + IL +/- insulin, +/- NaHCO3 for severe acidosis, dialysis for life-threatening acidosis or hyperammonemia Disorder Enzyme Blockade Accumulated Substrate(s) Presentation Treatment Methylmalonic acidemia methylmalonyl-CoA mutase deficiency (MM-CoA → succinyl CoA) Products of BCAAs (Ile, Val, Met) - MMA, methylcitrate, C3 acylcarnitine Stressor (illness, excess protein intake) → metabolic crisis (high-AG metabolic acidosis, basal ganglia stroke, pancreatitis). Complications: renal dz, intellectual disability. Variable age of onset. As above, plus Vitamin B12, liver or liver/kidney transplantation, avoid Ile, Val, Met, Thr in diet Propionic acidemia propionyl-CoA carboxylase deficiency (propionyl CoA → MM-CoA) Products of BCAAs (Ile, Val, Met) - 3-OH propionic acid, methylcitrate, C3 acylcarnitine Newborn period - profound metabolic acidosis w/ high AG and prominent ketosis → multiorgan dysfunction (cardiac, respiratory, pancytopenia, basal ganglia stroke, pancreatitis), hyperammonemia. Later - cardiomyopathy and dysrhythmias in early adulthood As above, plus liver transplant, avoid Ile, Val, Met, Thr in diet. Acutely, anabolic support, increase carnitine to protect mito from organic acids. Consider bowel regimen (stool can harbor toxic intermediates). Isovaleric acidemia isovaleryl-CoA dehydrogenase (isovaleryl-CoA → → acetoacetate and Ac-CoA) Products of Leu metabolism (Isovaleric acid and metabolites), C5 acylcarnitine Neonatal: severe lethargy and obtundation, +AG metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, ketonuria, hyperammonemia, odor of IVA in urine, pancreatitis. Infantile/late-onset: FTT, DD, seizures As above, avoid Leu Glutaric acidemia type I (GA1) Glutaryl CoA DH deficiency Products of Trp and Lys metab (plasma C5 dicarboxylic (C5DC) acylcarnitine) Macrocephaly (risk of tearing of bridging veins → subdural hemorrhage), metabolic basal ganglia stroke (unlikely after 6y), isolated cerebral acidosis – may not have metabolic acidosis/ketosis/hyperammonemia. Catabolic stress, fever → devastating neurologic injury (dystonia, movement disorders). As above, restrict Trp and Lys in diet, aggressive sick day management. Start D10 at 1.5x mIVF regardless of appearance. If controlled during childhood, outcomes excellent. 14.10 Peroxisomal Disorders 14.10.0.1 Biochemical defect Peroxisomes = site for β-ox of VLCFAs, H2O2 degradation, and pipecolic, phytanic, and pristanic acid metabolism, also of bile acid synthesis, plasmalogen formation (for membranes and myelin). 14.10.0.2 Presentation Dysmorphic facies (as below) alongside shortened proximal limbs, epiphyseal stippling, hypotonia, seizures, encephalopathy, cataracts, retinopathy, hepatomegaly, and cholestasis. 14.10.0.3 Workup Elevated levels of substrate in question (see below), enzyme assays Disorder Enzyme Blockade Accumulated Substrate(s) Presentation Treatment Zellweger Syndrome Several peroxisomal genes; often PEX1 VLCFAs and branched- chain FAs Early neuromotor arrest, seizures, ID, craniofacial anomalies (large fontanel, midface hypoplasia, short pf, incr. neck fat),chondrodysplasia punctata (calcification of cartilage), renal cysts, liver failure - cerebrohepatorenal syndrome, death w/in 1 yr Supportive care only; no disease-modifying rx Refsum Disease Defective phytanoyl-CoA -hydroxylase Phytanic acid Later onset (adolescence / adulthood) of ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa, ichthyosis, cataracts/night blindness, anosmia, and hearing loss Restrict phytanic acid intake (found in dairy, beef, lamb, seafood.

HSCT 14.11 Urea Cycle Defects PowerPlans: Several, including for known defects and unknown; search “metabolism urea” in PC for full list 14.11.0.1 Biochemical defect Deficiency in any of the 6 UC enzymes, which converting toxic nitrogenous metabolites from protein turnover to non-toxic urea for urinary excretion → NH3 accumulation. Urea cycle diagram with assocated disorders in blue. 14.11.0.2 Presentation Interim healthy period → catabolic stressor (stress, infection, surgery, or starvation) → vomiting, feeding intolerance, tachypnea (due to central hyperventilation) → encephalopathy and coma, with potentially irreversible brain damage if untreated. 14.11.0.3 Workup Labs w/ hyperammonemia and respiratory alkalosis → metabolic acidosis Definitive: plasma/urine levels of UCD metabolites and confirm with enzyme testing 14.11.0.4 Management (general approach) Bill’s Pearls: UCD management Children often look better than their ammonia level. Start anabolic support when they get to the ED! If they don’t have access, then get it as fast as you can. If they are not vomiting, protein-free formula run continuously through a G-tube provides more calories than IV fluid and is faster to get going. Acutely: immediate treatment of hyperammonemia (see full details in Metabolic crisis management section): Stop all protein intake (but no longer than 36-48h), give dex-containing IVF (10-25% @ 1.5xM) and IL (1-3 g/kg/d) through central line, NH3 scavengers (Ammonul = Na benzoate and Na phenylacetate) usually with IV arginine, avoid hypoNa (would exacerbate cerebral edema), prepare for HD (likely if NH3 &gt; 300 μmol/L) Long term: Low-protein diet, avoid catabolism, include missing UC intermediates, liver transplant Disorder Enzyme Blockade Accumulated Substrate(s) Presentation Treatment Ornithine Transcarbamylase Deficiency OTC (carbamoyl phosphate + ornithine → citrulline) - most common NH3 → cerebral edema. Glutamine elevation. Low arginine and citrulline as cycle is blocked proximally. Elevated orotic acid in urine X-linked recessive. Hyperammonemic crisis, typically early on, p/w poor feeding, lethargy, tachypnea, hypothermia, irritability, vomiting, ataxia, seizures, hepatomegaly, coma. NOT always evident on NBS, may flag for low citrulline As above, alongside: citrulline/ arginine, + carnitine, ammonia scavengers such as glycerol phenylbutyrate. Consider ammonul for acute hyperammonemia Citrullinemia Arginosuccinate synthetase (citrulline + aspartate → argininosuccinate) Same as OTC def but with elevated citrulline Similar to OTC def, but AR inheritance.

Oral rehydration is preferred to IV rehydration when possible If giving IV rehydration: 20cc/kg bolus of normal saline - consider D5NS if hypoglycemic or acidotic, rpt PRN until HDS, if ongoing IV rehydration necessary, start IVF @ maintenance (D5NS unless child is &lt;1 mo, has renal disease, etc); for hypernatremic dehydration, give hypotonic fluids (e.g., D5 ½ NS) after volume resuscitation. ###Maintenance Fluid Therapy | Fluid | Dex | Na+ | Cl- | K+ | Ca2+ | Buffer | Osm | |:————-:|:———:|:————–:|:————–:|:————-:|:—————:|:————:|:——:| | Unit | g/dL | mEq/L | mEq/L | mEq/L | mEq/L | mEq/L | mOsm/L | | Plasma | 0.07-0.11 | 135-145 | 95-105 | 3.5-5 | 4.4-5.2 | 20-30 bicarb | 308 | | NS (0.9%) | 0 | 154 | 154 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 308 | | D5 NS | 5 | 154 | 154 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 308 | | D5 ½ NS | 5 | 77 | 77 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 15 | | D5 ¼ NS | 5 | 34 | 34 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 78 | | 3% Saline | 0 | 513 | 513 | 0 | 0 | 0 | 1026 | | D5 LR | 5 | 130 | 109 | 4 | 3 | 28 lactate | 284 | ###Holliday-Segar Method Use for children &gt;14 days old Body Weight cc/kg/day cc/kg/hr First 10 kg 100 4 Second 10 kg 50 2 Each additional kg 20 1 Insensible Fluid Loss: \\(IFL_{(mL/day)}=300mL/m^{2}/day\\), with \\(BSA_{(m^{2})}=\\sqrt{\\frac{ht_{(cm)}\\times wt_{(kg)}}{3600}}\\) Maintenance Electrolyte Requirements: Na+: 2-4 mEq/kg/day / K+: 1-2 mEq/kg/day. Choice of fluid depends on age, serum sodium, and degree of dehydration. 2018 AAP Clinical Practice Guideline:10 Bottom line: when in doubt, use isotonic fluids + KCl and dextrose (e.g., D5NS + 20 mEq/L KCl) Exceptions: neonates &lt;28d or in NICU, CHF, renal disease, massive burns, hepatic disease, neurosurgical disorders, voluminous diarrhea, DI Why: avoids iatrogenic hyponatremia (hypotonic fluids + non-osmotic stimuli to ADH release) without a notable increase in iatrogenic hypernatremia or hypertension. Note: large amounts of NS → hyperchloremic non-gap metabolic acidosis. Keep this in mind when you see a persistent acidosis despite a normal anion gap when correcting patients in DKA! ##Acid/Base ###Simple Acid/Base Disorders | Disorder | pH | pCO2 | HCO3 | |———————–|:—–:|:—————:|—————–| | Metabolic Acidosis | &lt;7.35 | &gt;45 | &lt;22 | | Metabolic Alkalosis | &gt;7.45 | &lt;35 | &gt;26 | | Respiratory Acidosis | &lt;7.35 | &gt;45 | &lt;22 | | Respiratory Alkalosis | &gt;7.45 | &lt;35 | &gt;26 | Bold indicates primary disturbance – non-bold indicates secondary response. Note: lower serum bicarbonate levels (as low as 18 mmol/L) can be physiologically normal in neonates. Acidemia → pH &lt; 7.35. Acidosis → process that makes pH ↓ Alkalemia → pH &gt; 7.45. Alkalosis → process that makes pH ↑ In respiratory disorders, the pH moves in the same direction as the pCO2. Always look at the pH! A high bicarb on a chem often represents a metabolic alkalosis, but could also be a compensation for chronic respiratory acidosis (e.g., in patients with chronic lung disease). ###Metabolic Acidosis PowerPlans: Metabolism Lactic or Metabolic Acidosis NOS Admit Plan Approach: is there a concomitant respiratory acidosis / respiratory alkalosis? Use Winter’s Formula: \\(Expected\\: pCO_{2}=\\left [ \\left ( 1.5\\times HCO_{3}^{-} \\right ) + 8\\pm 2\\right ]\\) Calculate Anion Gap, \\(AG = Na^{+}-\\left ( Cl^{-} +HCO_{3}^-{}\\right )\\) In healthy patients, \\(Normal = 3\\times albumin\\pm 2\\) Normal AG MAc: GI loss (diarrhea, laxative, ureteroenteric fistula) vs renal loss (RTA (see chart), acetazolamide use, renal failure (may also have elevated AG), aggressive rehydration with NS. Calculate urine AG, \\(Urine\\:AG=(UNa^{+}+UK^{+})-UCl^{-}\\) (works b/c urine Cl- = proxy for NH4+ secretion) If positive → impaired renal acidification If negative → GI loss of bicarb Increased AG MAc: MUDPILES Methanol Uremia Diabetic ketoacidosis/starvation ketoacidosis Paraldehyde Infection/Isoniazid/Iron/IEM Lactic Acidosis Ethylene Glycol Salicylates (cause primary metabolic acidosis and respiratory alkalosis) Not fitting? Use the “delta gap”: compares difference between measured and normal AG vs difference between normal bicarb and measured bicarb to answer the question: is each decrease in the bicarb accounted for by an increase in the AG? \\[\\Delta Gap = \\frac{\\left ( AG - 12 \\right )}{\\left ( 24-bicarb \\right )}\\] If yes, then DGap = 0.8 to 2 → high AG metabolic acidosis (MAc) alone If no and DGap &lt; 0.4 → low/normal AG MAc alone If no and DGap 0.4-0.8 → low/normal AG MAc and high AG MAc If no and DGap &gt; 2 → high AG MAc superimposed on chronic metabolic alkalosis or respiratory acidosis with metabolic compensation Management: directed at underlying etiology; see Metabolism section for acute management. ####Renal Tubular Acidosis: Hyperchloremic Metabolic Acidosis w/ +Urine AG** | | Proximal (Type 2) | Distal (Type 1) | Hyperkalemic (Type 4) | |————————-|——————————————————————————————-|——————————————————————–|——————————————————————| | Defect | Bicarb reabsorption | H+ | Inadequate aldosterone | | Potassium | Normal/Decreased | Normal/Decreased | Increased | | Urine pH | &lt;5.5 | &gt;5.5 | &lt;5.5 | | Renal Stones | No | Yes (high urine pH → CaPhos stones, low urine citrate) | No | | Clinical Correlates | Fanconi Syndrome (generalized proximal tubular dysfunction → lose glucose, phos, AAs) | Hereditary channelopathies (may be a/w sensorineural hearing loss) | DM, primary adrenal insufficiency, use of ACEIs/aldo antagonists | ###Metabolic Alkalosis Chloride Responsive (urine Cl- &lt; 20 mEq/L): loss of gastric secretions (HCl): vomiting, NG tube drainage, thiazide and loop diuretics (urine chloride varies based on when drug was given), CF Chloride Resistant (urine Cl- &gt; 20 mEq/L): w/ HTN: primary hyperaldosteronism, CAH, renovascular HTN, Liddle’s syndrome w/o HTN: Bartter / Gitelman syndrome, severe K or Mg loss ###Respiratory Acidosis DDx CNS depression Nervous/Muscular disorders (Guillain-Barre, myasthenia gravis, botulism, muscular dystrophy) Acute and chronic lung disease Workup/Management: ABG/VBG, CXR, SaO2, escalate respiratory support as needed ###Respiratory Alkalosis DDx Anxiety Hypoxia Pain Salicylates Urea cycle disorders (during metabolic crisis, hyperammonemia increases respiratory drive) ##Hyponatremia Categorization Mild: Na+ &lt; 135 mEq/L Moderate: Na+ &lt; 130 mEq/L Severe: Na+ &lt; 120 mEq/L Hypovolemic Evolemic Hypervolemic | Nonrenal sodium losses: GI, skin, sequestration Renal sodium losses: diuretics, cerebral salt wasting, mineralocorticoid/glucocorticoid deficiency | SIADH Psychogenic polydipsia Reset osmostat Drug-induced Hypothyroidism | Edematous states: nephrotic syndrome, CHF, cirrhosis Renal failure (acute or chronic) | Serum Osmolality in Hyponatremia Presentation Usually d/t underlying cause rather than symptoms from hyponatremia itself. Sx occur when hyponatremia evolves acutely (&lt;24h) &amp; include N/V/HA → seizures, coma, and respiratory arrest. Workup Chem 10, serum Osm (↓ in true hyponatremia. If ↑, look for hyperglycemia or other osms) UA (proteinuria, hematuria, glucosuria), urine Osm. If euvolemic, nl response to hyponatremia = suppress ADH → urine is maximally dilute (osmolality &lt; 100 mosmol/kg, SG ≤1.003). Abnormally conc urine + euvolemic hypoNa = SIADH (whereas ↑ ADH i/s/o hypovolemia = appropriate ↑ in ADH) Urine Na+ (&lt;20 = EABV depletion; &gt;40 = SIADH, cerebral salt wasting, diuretic use, renal failure) Management: address underlying cause (volume if hypovolemic, fluid restriction if eu/hypervolemic), time course to match timing of onset (fast rx for onset &lt;12h, slow rx for slow onset to prevent CPM). Acute, symptomatic: ICU admit, 3% HTS to raise [Na+] by 3-5 mEq/L (give ~TBW x 5 mEq/L x 2). Chronic, asymptomatic: calculate Na+ Deficit (mEq) = (140 – Na+actual) x TBW, where TBW = weight in kg x 0.6 for males, 0.5 for females. Then give IVF to account for missing Na+ content; should not exceed 0.5 mEq/L/hr rise in [Na+]. SIADH: restrict free water intake to match insensible losses + UOP; use vaptans if severe. ##Hypernatremia Definition: Na+ &gt; 145mEq/L Etiology: excessive water loss (GI losses / Diuretics / Central or nephrogenic DI (see endocrine section) / Osmotic diuresis / Increased insensible losses / Impaired thirst mechanism) vs excessive salt provision Clinical Presentation: lethargy, irritability, MS changes. Typically presents w/ sx of underlying cause. Exam: check volume status, neurologic exam, mental status. Workup: UA, chem 10, urine osm (appropriate response to hyperNa → ↑ ADH → concentrated urine. Inappropriately dilute urine i/s/o hyperNa → think DI), serum osm (Uosm &lt; Sosm → think DI). Management For hypernatremic dehydration, calculate Free Water Deficit(L) = \\(\\left ( \\frac{Current\\: Na^{+}}{Desired\\: Na^{+}} -1\\right )\\)xTBW, where TBW = weight in kg x 0.6 for males, 0.5 for females. Replace ½ of FWD w/in 24h, then remainder over next 1-2 days, and replace maintenance + ongoing losses. Avoid ↓ Na+ by &gt;15 mEq/L over 24h (0.5 mEq/L/hr) due to risk of cerebral edema. If due to DI, see endo section for management ##Hypokalemia PowerPlan: MSICU Intermittent IV Electrolyte Replacement Orderset Definition: K+ &lt; 3.5 mEq/L Etiology: decreased K+ intake (malnutrition), increased K+ entry into cells (alkalosis → H+ for K+ / insulin / beta adrenergic activity - albuterol, pheo), increased GI losses (diarrhea, vomiting, laxative abuse, copious GT losses), renal losses (diuretics due to loops/thiazides but NOT aldo antagonists, mineralocorticoid excess – primary hyperaldo, hyperreninemic states [p/w HTN, hyperNa, metabolic alkalosis], Type I/II RTA, Gitelman/Bartter) Pathophysiology: low K+ → hyperpolarization of myocytes → lack of inhibition of voltage-gated Na+ channels → ↑ Na+ entry into myocytes and ↑ excitability → cardiac arrhythmias Clinical Presentation (generally only K+ &lt; 3): muscle weakness, fatigue, constipation → ileus, tetany, rhabdo, respiratory muscle failure, EKG changes (ST depression → dec T wave amplitude → U waves) EKG Changes in Hypokalemia Workup: Chem 10, EKG (see above),\\(TTKG= \\left ( \\frac{Urine\\: K^{+}}{Plasma\\: K^{+}} \\right )/{\\left ( \\frac{Urine\\: Osm}{Plasma\\: Osm} \\right )}\\) (note: can only use when urine osm &gt;300). TTKG &gt;3 i/s/o hypoK suggests aldo excess. Management Mild to moderate (K+ = 3.0-3.5 mEq/L): treat underlying d/o, give KCl 1 mEq/kg (max 20 mEq) PO q8-24h OR add KCl to IVF (max conc is 80 mEq/L via PIV). Severe (K+ &lt; 2.5-3 mEq/L or symptomatic, EKG changes): add KCl to IVF, give KCl 0.5-1 mEq/kg (max 30 mEq) IV x1 (only in ICU!), and should have EKG monitoring during infusion. Also correct Mg2+ if low (25-50 mg/kg IV, max 2g/dose) as hypoMg prevents resolution of hypoK. ##Hyperkalemia PowerPlan: MICU/MSICU/NICU hyperkalemia Orderset Definition: K+ &gt; 5.5 mEq/L (up to 6.5 may be normal in neonates) Etiology: ↑ K+ intake (TPN, IVF, formula), ↑ K+release from cells [acidosis (K+ efflux allows H+ influx to buffer acidosis), cell lysis (hemolysis, rhabdo, tumor lysis)], ↓ renal excretion [acute or chronic renal failure, hypoaldosteronism (adrenal insufficiency, hyporeninemic hypoAldo, ACE inhibitors – look for hypoNa and metabolic acidosis), K+-sparing diuretics (spironolactone, epelrenone, amiloride, triamterene)], pseudohyperkalemia (hemolyzed blood sample) Clinical Presentation: muscle weakness (LE &gt; UE) → flaccid paralysis, arrhythmias (if K+ &gt; 7). EKG changes (in order of appearance): tall peaked T wave, shortened QT → PR/QRS lengthening → “sine wave” QRS → VFib EKG Changes in Hyperkalemia Workup: Chem 10 (ensure not hemolyzed – free-flowing sample, order STAT), blood gas to assess acid/base status, EKG, TTKG (see above) – low TTKG (&lt;7) in setting of hyperkalemia may indicate aldo deficiency or resistance, plasma renin and aldosterone. Management: if real and with EKG changes. STOP K+ supplementation, K+-containing IVF, and K+-sparing medications. Stabilize cardiac membrane Calcium gluconate 10% @ 0.5 mL/kg (=100 mg/kg) IV over 5 min. Calcium chloride 20 mg/kg IV over 5-10 min if impending cardiac arrest. Drive K+ into cells Insulin 0.1 U/kg, max 10U IV with glucose, infuse over 30 min: &lt;5 yo: D10 (100 mg/mL) @ 5 mL/kg ≥5 yo: D25 (250 mg/mL) @ 2-4 mL/kg IV (max 25g) Albuterol nebs Neonates: 0.4 mg/2 mL NS &lt;25 kg: 2.5 mg/2 mL NS 25-50 kg: 5 mg/2 mL NS 50 kg: 10 mg/2-4 mL NS or 4-8 MDI puffs Bicarb: 1 mEq/kg IV (max 50 mEq) over 10-15 min &lt;6 mo: 2 mL/kg of 4.2% NaHCO3 ≥6 mo: 1 mL/kg of 8.4% NaHCO3 Intubate + hyperventilate (induce alkalosis) Excrete total body K+ Kayexalate 1 g/kg, max 50g PO/PR q4h PRN Furosemide 1-2 mg/kg IV (max 40 mg or 80 mg if renal insufficiency) q6h PRN Dialysis if emergent or if ongoing source of K+ release (tumor lysis, rhabdo) ##Proteinuria Definition Excessive excretion of urinary protein Dipstick: primarily detects albumin Trace = 15-30 mg/dL 1+ = 30-100 mg/dL 2+ = 100-300 mg/dL 3+ = 300-1000 mg/dL 4+ = &gt;1000 mg/dL If positive dip, perform quantitative analysis Spot UPCR: nl &lt;0.2 if ≤2 yo or &lt;0.5 if &lt;2 yo; &gt;2 = nephrotic (see below section on nephrotic syndrome) Urinary Protein Excretion 24h: &gt;100 mg/m2 per day = abnormal, ≥1000 mg/m2 per day = nephrotic Etiology Glomerular [inc filtration of macromolecules, esp albumin – may be transient (fever, exercise, stress, seizures, resolves on rpt testing after stressor gone) vs orthostatic (present when standing and not when supine - first morning void) vs persistent (elevated on both supine/upright voids)] Tubular [inc excretion of low molecular weight proteins, esp β2 microglobulin, that are normally filtered in the glomerulus and reabsorbed in the proximal tubule – may be d/t congenital disorders of proximal tubule (Fanconi syndrome, cystinosis, galactosemia, Lowe syndrome) or with acute tubular injury (ATN, AIN, pyelo)] Overflow [inc excretion of low molecular weight proteins d/t protein overproduction (multiple myeloma, myoglobin in rhabdomyolysis)]. Clinical Presentation If significant quantity, protein will be frothy; otherwise varies with cause. If nephrotic, may have edema/HTN, may have stigmata of primary dx (oral ulcers, rash, and joint swelling in SLE; abdominal pain and palpable purpura in HSP; h/o recurrent UTIs with VUR, hepatitis and movement d/o in Wilson disease). Workup Proteinuria Workup ##Hematuria Definition: red blood cells in the urine Etiology Extraglomerular: UTI, ureteral trauma, nephrolithiasis, cystitis (any UTI, adenovirus, cyclophosphamide), sickle cell disease or trait, malignancy (bladder CA, Wilms tumor) Glomerular: glomerulonephritis (see GN section), benign familial hematuria / thin basement membrane disease Workup UA (+blood on dip AND +RBCs on micro) If only +blood, think myoglobin vs hemoglobin If red but neg blood/neg RBC, think beets, rifampin, nitrofurantoin, doxorubicin, chloroquine If cola- or tea-colored urine, RBC casts, marked proteinuria, or dysmorphic RBCs, think GN If blood clots, uniform RBCs, urethral bleeding, think extra-gl If h/o trauma, do CTAP If s/sx UTI, do UCx If s/sx nephrolithiasis, do renal US +/- CTAP If c/f GN, send chem 10, CBC w/diff + retic, C3/C4, albumin, ASLO titer, anti-DNase B, ANA, UPCR; consider renal biopsy if concomitant proteinuria/HTN and/or rising serum creatinine ##Nephrotic Syndrome Definition: syndrome characterized by presence of heavy proteinuria (albuminuria &gt;3 g/24 hours), hypoalbuminemia (&lt;3.0 g/dL), edema, and hyperlipidemia. Etiology Minimal change disease (most common in children) – see normal light microscopy but on EM there is diffuse foot process effacement Focal Segmental Glomerulosclerosis Membranous Nephropathy Membranoproliferative GN (may be nephrotic + nephritic) SLE (may be nephrotic + nephritic) IgA/HSP (may be nephrotic + nephritic) Post-infectious Glomerulonephritis (may be nephrotic + nephritic) Pathophysiology Abnormalities in glomerular podocytes → increased filtration of proteins, esp albumin. Others include clotting inhibitors (Protein C, S, antithrombin III) → prothrombotic state and immunoglobulins → susceptibility to serious infections. Increased Na+ retention and hypoalbuminemia → edema Decreased oncotic pressure → inc hepatic lipoprotein synthesis → hypercholesterolemia Clinical Presentation Edema, typically first appears in periorbital tissue/scrotum, then in dependent areas HTN, HLD, increased risk of VTE Can present with AKI Exam: edema, hypertension, assess for extra-renal findings that may suggest a secondary cause for nephrotic syndrome (e.g. infection) Workup Chem 10 / C3; see also section on proteinuria UA + 24 hour urine collection with protein ≥1000 mg/m2/day OR spot UPCR &gt;3.5 Consider renal biopsy for diagnosis (see below) Management Empiric steroids for presumed minimal change disease (if persistent past 1-2 wk). Prednisone 60 mg/m2/day (max 60 mg/day) for 4 weeks. Then prednisone 40 mg/m2/day QOD for 4 weeks w/ gradual taper, generally for minimum total 2-3 months. Consider biopsy if steroid resistant, steroid-dependent, or evidence of steroid toxicity. BP Control - ACE inhibitors or ARBs are preferred (decrease glomerular pressure → decreased protein filtration). e.g., enalapril 0.08 mg/kg per day (maximum of 5 mg/day), can titrate to maximum dose of 0.6 mg/kg per day (maximum of 40 mg/day) for appropriate BP response Use with caution for GFR &lt; 60 mL/min/1.73 m2. Re-check serum Cr, K+ 3-5 days after starting ACEI/ARB. Edema - salt restriction (&lt; 2 mEq/kg/day) and diuretics. If intravascular volume normal (FENa &gt;2 %) - furosemide 1-2 mg/kg/dose x2 doses. If intravascular volume low (FENa &lt; 2%) and edema is severe (anasarca, pleural effusions, ascites) Albumin 25% 1 gram/kg IV over 4 hours. Give 1 mg/kg IV lasix at the 2 hour point Give 1 mg/kg IV lasix after albumin infusion (4 hour point). VTE Consider prophylactic anticoagulation if high-risk (age &gt;12, albumin &lt;2, fibrinogen &gt;6). Treat VTE if present with LMWH HLD - consider statin, especially if other ASCVD risk factors are present. ##Nephritic Syndrome Definition: any of several conditions leading to glomerular hematuria, proteinuria, and potential AKI with azotemia/oliguria, edema, and hypertension. Etiology Post-infectious Group A β-hemolytic strep, either after pharyngitis or impetigo Other infections: Staph aureus/epi, Pneumococcus, Mycoplasma, viral IgA Nephropathy (most common glomerulopathy worldwide) SLE Nephritis Membranoproliferative GN: can be idiopathic or secondary to HBV/HCV or rheumatologic disease Alport Syndrome: XLR collagen IV mutations, a/w hearing loss, vision changes Goodpasture Syndrome: autoAb to Type IV collagen in glomerular and alveolar basement membranes → hemoptysis Vasculitis: HSP, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (lung/sinus/kidney), eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis (asthma/neuropathy/lung/kidney/skin), microscopic polyangiitis (lung/kidney) Clinical Presentation Hypertension Hematuria Fluid retention/edema Sequelae of underlying disease SLE: rash, arthritis, oral ulcers Vasculitides: hemoptysis, skin ulcers Alport: sensorineural hearing loss, vision changes Ask about preceding sore throat (usually 2-3 weeks before onset of post strep GN) or current URI symptoms (which can be seen with IgAN). Some patients may have rapid progression with development of acute renal failure over the course of several days. Any of the above etiologies can have a rapidly progressive course. Exam: monitor BP, assess volume status. Look for signs of Lupus or other vasculitides such as rash, abdominal tenderness (HSP), joint swelling/tenderness. Workup UA: RBCs + proteinuria. Glomerular bleeding → dysmorphic RBCs and red cell casts. Chem 10 / CBC w/ diff + retic / serum albumin / ASLO titer + anti-DNase B / ANA + anti-dsDNA C3, C4: low C3 seen with post-infectious GN and C3 glomerulopathy; low C3/C4 in SLE; normal C3/C4 in IgAN, pauci-immune GNs (ANCA-associated vasculitis), and anti-GBM disease UPCR: typically will see proteinuria, sometimes in nephrotic range (nephrotic range protein is UPCR &gt; 3.5). If rapidly progressive course or significant renal insufficiency on admission, send anti-GBM Ab and ANCA (for Goodpasture disease and GPA/MPA). Patients with rapidly progressive course should also have renal biopsy. Management Reasons for admission: hypertension, acute renal failure, volume overload, or electrolyte abnormalities. Hypertension typically responsive to diuretics. Fluid and sodium restriction during acute phase. Patients with RPGN may be treated with pulse dose steroids. *Patients with RPGN due to Goodpasture disease, SLE, or GPA/MPA may be treated with steroids, cyclophosphamide, and plasmapheresis. Post-infectious GN is typically self-resolving. Patients suspected to have post-infectious GN should have repeat complement studies sent in 8-12 weeks, at which time complement should return to normal. If still hypocomplementemic, consider other diagnoses such as C3 glomerulopathy or SLE. ##Acute Kidney Injury Definition: acute decrease in GFR per KDIGO criteria. AKI Staging Etiology Pre-Renal: decreased renal perfusion. Decreased intravascular volume: dehydration, blood loss. Decreased effective circulating volume: shock, heart failure, cirrhosis. Renal: intrinsic renal parenchymal disease. Glomerular disease: glomerulonephritis, nephrotic disorders. Vascular: vasculitis. Tubulointerstitial: ATN (ischemia/progression of pre-renal AKI, aminoglycosides, myoglobin, uric acid in tumor lysis syndrome), interstitial nephritis (NSAIDs, penicillins). Post-Renal: obstructive uropathy (posterior urethral valves, tumor, large stones, etc). Needs to be bilateral obstruction to develop renal failure in a patient with otherwise normal kidneys. Clinical Presentation Fluid retention: edema, decreased urine output. Hematuria with intrinsic kidney injury (glomerulonephritis, ATN). Uremia: nausea/vomiting, GI bleeding, pericarditis, pruritus, mental status change. Exam: look for hypertension and edema (periorbital and peripheral). Workup Urine Studies UA Hematuria, proteinuria, red cell casts suggests glomerulonephritis. Muddy brown casts suggests ATN. Urine eosinophils suggests acute interstitial nephritis (not a great test, may be positive even if only 1 eosinophil). Urine electrolytes to calculate fractional excretion sodium (FENa). \\(FENa=\\frac{\\left ( Urine\\: Na^{^{+}}\\times Plasma\\: Cr \\right )}{\\left ( Plasma\\: Na^{+}\\times Urine\\: Cr \\right )}\\) FENa &lt; 1% suggests prerenal; FENa &gt; 2% suggests intrarenal. Blood Labs: Chem 10, CBC w/ diff, consider CK if history suggestive of rhabdomyolysis. Renal US to look for hydronephrosis, obstructive uropathy, renal scarring. Management Correct associated electrolyte issues (hyperkalemia, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, acidosis). Manage hypertension (see section below). Fluid management Small NS bolus (5-10 cc/kg) if hypovolemic or in pre-renal failure. Reassess volume status and continue to give small boluses until patient is euvolemic. Replace insensible losses plus 1:1 urine/stool output. \\(IFL_{(mL/day)}=300mL/m^{2}/day\\) \\(BSA_{(m^{2})}=\\sqrt{\\frac{ht_{(cm)}\\times wt_{(kg)}}{3600}}\\) Indications for dialysis: AEIOU Acidosis Electrolyte anomalies refractory to medical management (hyperK/phos) Ingestions (Li+, ASA) Overload Uremia (pericarditis, encephalopathy) ##Chronic Kidney Disease Definition Irreversible kidney damage and reduction in kidney function; may be progressive. Requires 1 of 2 of the following (2012 KDIGO Clinical Practice Guideline): For age ≥ 2 yo GFR &lt; 60 mL/1.73 m2 for &gt; 3 mo GFR &gt; 60 mL/1.73 m2 alongside evidence of structural kidney damage or other marker of abnormal renal function (proteinuria, albuminuria, renal tubular d/o). For age &lt; 2 yo → GFR &lt; 1 std dev below mean = mod dysfunction, &lt; 2 std dev = severe. Severity stratified by GFR from G1 (normal, ≥ 90) → G2 (60-89) → G3a (45-59) → G3b (30-44) → G4 (15-29) → G5 (&lt; 15) = ESRD / dialysis-dependence. Etiology Congenital causes (renal aplasia, reflux, PKD, obstructive uropathy) in ~60%. Glomerular disease (FSGS, membranous nephropathy, MPGN, SLE nephritis, etc.). Other: HUS, Alport syndrome, cystinosis, interstitial nephritis, tumors. Pathophysiology: multiple possible insults leading to intraglomerular HTN and glomerular hypertrophy → nephron loss → hyperfiltration in remaining nephrons → further glomerular damage → glomerulosclerosis, proteinuria, fibrosis. Clinical Presentation Edema + HTN Proteinuria / hypoalbuminemia Anemia (due to EPO deficiency) Dyslipidemia / accelerated ASCVD Vitamin D deficiency with secondary hyperparathyroidism Electrolyte derangements: hyperkalemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, metabolic acidosis Growth failure, delayed puberty, and intellectual disability Complications of uremia: pericarditis, platelet dysfunction, encephalopathy Workup Chem 10 CBC w/diff + retic + iron studies UA w/ UPCR 25-OH Vitamin D, PTH Fasting lipid panel If etiology uncertain: see sections on proteinuria/hematuria, consider renal U/S and bx. Management Stage G1/G2 Monitor kidney function closely. Educate about nephrotoxin avoidance (NSAIDs, contrast, smoking, obesity, dehydration). BP control w/ ACEI/ARB based on guidelines from the ESCAPE Trial.11 Using ramipril (starting at 6 mg/m2/d and inc dose / adding other agents as needed). Targeting 50th-%ile BP for age, sex, and weight vs 90th-%ile slowed rate of progression to ESRD. Stages G3 and above: as above and add the following. Prepare for possibility of transplant, ideally prior to dialysis (HD vs peritoneal). Na+-restricted diet (2-3g/d) +/- diuretics (furosemide 0.5-2 mg/kg/d, HCTZ 1-3 mg/kg/d). Management of hyperkalemia (low K+ diet, diuretics), acidosis (sodium bicarb), hypocalcemia/hyperphosphatemia (Vitamin D, calcimimetics, phos binders). Rx anemia to goal Hgb 10-12 g/dL w/ EPO-stimulating agents (erythropoietin alfa, darbepoetin alfa). In pts with significant uremia, consider preoperative DDAVP to prevent bleeding. ##Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome Definition Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome: microangiopathic hemolytic anemia + AKI + thrombocytopenia Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura: triad of HUS + fever + neurologic changes Etiology Principally affects children under the age of five years. 90% due to shiga toxin; of those 70% due to enterohemorrhagic E. Coli. Occurs in 6-9% of EHEC infections; usually begins 5-10 days after diarrhea onset. Non-diarrheal (atypical) HUS associated can be due to S. pneumo infection or due to defects in the complement system (e.g., mutations in complement regulatory proteins). Pathophysiology HUS: Shiga toxin binds to receptors in glomerular, colonic, and cerebral cells → promotes adhesion and aggregation of platelets onto endothelial cells → thrombocytopenia and RBC shearing (microangiopathic anemia); in kidney, glomerular damage. TTP: due to deficiency or immune-mediated inhibition of ADAMTS13, a metalloproteinase responsible for breakdown of vWF. No vWF cleavage → coagulation occurs at a higher rate, particularly in microvasculature → platelet consumption → thrombocytopenia and microthrombi → microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Clinical Presentation Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia → jaundice, pallor, dark urine. Thrombocytopenia → petechiae, bleeding. Acute renal failure → HTN, edema. Other systems Central nervous system: seizures, coma, stroke Cardiac: dysfunction due to ischemia, uremia, fluid overload Pancreas: transient DM Liver: hepatomegaly, increased serum transaminases Heme: in addition to anemia and thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis is common in diarrhea-induced HUS; the prognosis is worse with increased white blood cell counts. Workup CBC w/diff + retic: anemia, thrombocytopenia w/ appropriate reticulocytosis. Smear: schistocytes ↑ LDH, ↓ haptoglobin, Coombs negative (evidence of intravascular hemolysis). Chem 10: evidence of acute kidney injury, elevated BUN/Cr LFTs: elevation in transaminases, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia UA: possible proteinuria, hematuria. Stool culture: causative pathogen Head CT if any change in MS or abnormal neurologic exam. Management Treatment mainly supportive; judicious fluid management (see section on AKI), correct electrolyte abnormalities, transfuse RBCs if needed (avoid platelets unless actively bleeding, as this may worsen the TMA process), manage hypertension. If significant CNS involvement or if TTP is suspected, consider plasmapheresis. For non-STx mediated (atypical) HUS, consider eculizumab (anti-C5 antibody; prevents activation of terminal complement pathway). 5-10% mortality; 5-10% progress to ESRD. Inc WBC, seizure, or CVA = poor prognostic factors. ##Hypertension Definition12 Children 1-13 Years Old Children &gt; 13 Years Old Normal &lt;90th percentile &lt;120/&lt;80 mmHg Elevated BP ≥90th percentile to &lt;95th percentile or 120/80 mmHg to &lt;95th percentile (whichever is lower) 120/&lt;80 to 129/&lt;80 mmHg Stage 1 HTN ≥95th percentile to &lt;95th percentile +12 mmHg or 130/80 to 139/89 mmHg (whichever is lower) 130/80 to 139/89 mmHg Stage 2 HTN ≥95th percentile + 12 mmHg or ≥140/90 mmHg (whichever is lower) ≥140/90 mmHg *Percentiles determined by gender, age, and height. Blood Pressure Levels for Boys13 BP Levels for Boys Blood Pressure Levels for Girls14 BP Levels for Girls Etiology Essential Hypertension Most common etiology in older children; increasing incidence with rise in obesity. More likely in children who are overweight, postpubertal, and/or have a family history of hypertension. Secondary Hypertension Suspect in child &lt;6, w/o family hx HTN, if acute rise in BP, or past hx suspicious of underlying etiology. Renal Parenchymal Disease Glomerulonephritis, both acute and chronic Renal scarring from pyelonephritis, VUR → CKD. Renovascular Renal artery stenosis: fibromuscular dysplasia, Neurofibromatosis I, Williams Syndrome Thromboembolism (e.g., h/o UAC) Aortic coarctation Vasculitis: Takayasu’s arteritis, polyarteritis nodosa Endocrine Hyperthyroidism Catecholamine excess: pheochromocytoma, neuroblastoma, exogenous catecholamines (cold medications, cocaine, amphetamines) Corticosteroid excess: exogenous or endogenous (Cushing’s) Mineralocorticoid excess: congenital adrenal hyperplasia, primary hyperaldosteronism Neurologic: intracranial hypertension, familial dysautonomia Clinical Presentation Depends on etiology; essential hypertension often asymptomatic and discovered on routine blood pressure screening. Renal parenchymal disease: may present with hematuria, edema. Catecholamine excess: headache, flushing, sweating, tachycardia. Hyperthyroidism: sweating, diarrhea, tachycardia. Hypertensive emergency can present with headache, altered mental status, chest pain, dyspnea (see section on hypertensive emergency). Workup Phase 1: Confirmation Manual auscultatory measurement with appropriate-sized cuff on 3 separate occasions. Bladder width: &gt; 40% of upper arm circumference. Bladder length: &gt; 80% of upper arm circumference. Consider BP measurements at school, home, or ambulatory BP monitoring. Phase 2: Screening Studies Urinalysis (microscopic if positive). Chem 10 + uric acid (if concern for oncologic etiology, can also be elevated in essential HTN). Renal ultrasound with doppler interrogation. If obese, add HgA1c and ALT. Phase 3: Directed Testing Determine etiology (tests to consider based on history, PE, screening results). TFTs Plasma/urine catecholamines and metanephrines Renin/aldosterone DMSA scan to identify renal scarring in the setting of severe VUR. Renal arteriography Assess for end-organ damage. Echocardiogram (?LVH) Dilated eye exam (?retinal changes) Management For essential hypertension, can consider dietary/lifestyle modifications as first-line approach for patients with Stage 1 hypertension and no evidence of end-organ damage. Pharmacologic therapy typically indicated for patients with Stage 2 hypertension, symptomatic hypertension, evidence of end-organ damage, or Stage 1 hypertension that does not improve after 4-6 months of lifestyle modifications. Choice of pharmacologic agent depends on underlying etiology. For renin-mediated hypertension (renal artery stenosis, renal scarring), ACE-inhibitor usually best choice (e.g., enalapril 0.08 mg/kg/day). For volume-related hypertension (e.g., glomerulonephritis) use diuretics (e.g., HCTZ 1-3 mg/kg once daily). General principle is to choose one medication and increase dose until reach maximum recommended dose, then add an additional agent until hypertension controlled. For treatment of hypertensive emergency, refer to hypertensive emergency section in critical care chapter. ##Urinary Tract Infections Definition Age &lt; 2 mo: ≥ 50,000 CFU/mL of a uropathogen OR 10,000-50,000 CFU/mL with pyuria on UA Age ≥ 2 mo: significant bacteriuria (≥100,000 CFU/mL of single uropathogen from clean catch or ≥50,000 CFU/mL of uropathogen from cath sample) with associated inflammatory response (+LE/nitrite/WBC – except if due to Enterococcus, Klebsiella, or PsA) and lower urinary tract symptoms (if appropriate age) Cystitis: infection of urinary bladder Pyelonephritis: infection of upper urinary tract (kidneys and ureters) Etiology ~90% due to E coli; others include Enterococcus, Proteus, Pseudomonas, and Enterobacter Adenovirus may cause acute infectious cystitis Risk factors Ages 2-23 months: age &lt;12 mo, max T ≥ 39 °C, nonblack race, female sex, uncircumcised male, no additional source of fever identified Ages ≥ 2 years Female sex (shorter urethra, wetter periurethral environment) Lack of circumcision (in male infants) Sexual activity (receptive vaginal intercourse – S saprophyticus; unprotected insertive anal intercourse) Urinary tract anomalies (bladder stones, constipation, urinary retention, posterior urethral valves, VUR) Bladder catheterization or instrumentation (predisposes to PsA, coag-neg Staph) Sickle cell disease DM or other immunosuppressive conditions Pathophysiology Newborns: rare in first 6d life. May be due to hematogenous spread or ascending infection. Hematogenous spread more likely among preterm infants. Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract may predispose to UTI. Beyond newborn period: colonization of periurethral area by uropathogens → attachment of pathogens to uroepithelium → inflammatory response. Inflammation of upper urinary tract (pyelonephritis) → renal scarring → HTN, ESRD. Clinical Presentation Age &lt; 2 years: fever may be sole manifestation, esp when ≥ 39 °C (102.2 °F). Concomitant upper respiratory infection or AOM does not r/o UTI. May have concomitant poor feeding, irritability, or FTT. May cause conjugated hyperbilirubinemia. Age ≥ 2 years Cystitis: dysuria, urinary frequency, hematuria, suprapubic pain and TTP Pyelonephritis: fever, flank/back pain, nausea/vomiting, headache Workup Don’t Forget the UTI Clinical Pathway Age &lt; 2 mo: catheterized UA + urine culture Obtain blood culture given risk of urosepsis. Strongly consider LP (1-3% of infants with UTI have bacterial meningitis). Obtain renal/bladder U/S and consider VCUG if abnormal, if UTI is recurrent, or if pathogen other than E. Coli is identified. If ultrasound suggests renal damage - consider DMSA scan after resolution of acute illness. Age 2 mo-2 years UTI Risk Score Two points if: temp ≥40oC, no alternative source of fever, female. One point if: temp Temp ≥39oC, male uncircumsized &lt;12mo, male circumsized &lt;6 mo, fever ≥2 days, sibling w/ VUR, prior UTI. Low pre-test probability of UTI → consider starting with POCT UA on bagged urine sample. If normal, stop. If abnormal, obtain catheterized UA and send for culture. Do NOT send a bagged sample for culture. High pre-test probability of UTI (female w/ risk score ≥2, male w/ risk score ≥3) → obtain catheterized UA and send for culture. Age ≥ 2 years: clean catch UA → if +LE, nitrite, or WBC, send for culture. Consider empiric antibiotics for ≥1+ LE and nitrite, ≥1+ LE +/- nitrite, or ≥10 WBC/hpf. Consider baseline creatinine if initiating nephrotoxic antibiotics . Consider CRP and procalcitonin: CRP &lt;2 mg/dL helps exclude pyelo, while procalcitonin &gt;0.5 ng/mL can help confirm pyelo. Management Neonate 0-1 month (consult reference for preterm neonates): See BCH Clinical Pathway for Fever 0-1 month for additional recommendations. ≥35 wk GA and ≤7 days old Ampicillin 50 mg/kg IV q8h Cefotaxime 50 mg/kg/dose q8h OR Gentamicin 4 mg/kg IV q24h ≥35 wk GA and &gt;7 days old Ampicillin 50 mg/kg IV q6h Cefotaxime 50 mg/kg/dose q12h OR Gentamicin 5 mg/kg IV q24h Infant/Child/Adolescent Duration: 5-7 days if afebrile, 7-10 days if febrile. 1st line: cephalexin 25 mg/kg/dose PO TID (max 500 mg/dose) vs ceftriaxone 50 mg/kg/dose IV q24h (max 2 g/dose). 2nd line: TMP/SMX, amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefdinir, cefuroxime, ciprofloxacin (for adolescents with pyelo), nitrofurantoin (for adolescents with cystitis). If Grade III-V VUR is identified on VCUG, can consider prophylactic antibiotics, though the decrease in UTIs is exactly matched by an increase in MDROs as the etiology for UTI, when present.15 ##Nephrolithiasis Definition: deposits of minerals within the kidney or the urinary tract. Risk Factors: underlying risk factors are present in ~75-85% of children. PMHx or FHx of stone Abnormal urinary system anatomy (ADPKD, UPJ obstruction) Previous urological surgery Metabolic disorder → solute excess (hypercalciuria, hyperoxaluria, hyperuricemia) or ↓ levels of inhibitors of stone formation (hypocitraturia, hypomagnesemia) Chronic predisposing condition (IBD, CF, lymphoproliferative disorder, GSD, RTA) Medications predisposing to stone formation (diuretics, steroids, topiramate, high dose vitamin C) Recurrent UTIs Etiology: majority of stones are CaOx, followed by CaPhos, struvite, cystine, and then uric acid. Clinical Presentation: classic symptoms of abdominal/flank pain, hematuria, and dysuria Younger children tend to lack the classical symptoms. If diagnosed with UTI and not getting better with abx, consider nephrolithiasis. Admission criteria: Admit if unstable VS, inadequate pain control, poor hydration. Workup Urine studies Can do POCT UA, but consider formal if trying to clarify hematuria; UCx if c/f infection. Begin straining urine. Majority of urine/stone testing can wait until outpatient follow-up. Imaging US preferred, but may miss small or ureteral stones. If no stone on US ± CT (may not need if normal anatomy and no other s/sx). Management: see Nephrolithiasis Clinical Pathway for additional recommendations.

Immune therapies (glucocorticoids, IVIG, PLEX relatively contra-indicated given direct viral infection) 16.2.5.7 Complications Respiratory failure. Rare cases of A71 causing brainstem encephalitis with non-cardiogenic pulmonary edema and rapidly fatal cardiopulmonary failure. 16.3 Hypotonia 16.3.1 Approach to Neonatal Hypotonia 16.3.1.1 Pathophysiology Central (UMN) vs. peripheral (LMN) injury or dysfunction leading to decreased tone, which is resistance to passive stretch of the muscle at joints, often but not always associated w/ weakness 16.3.1.2 Presentation Head lag, frog-legged positioning, slip-through on vertical suspension, U-shape on horizontal suspension. Failure to meet developmental milestones. Also with dysphagia, FTT. 16.3.1.3 Differential Central (HIE, TORCH, brain malformations, IEM, genetic disorders, mitochondrial disease, hemorrhage/stroke) vs. peripheral (SMA, myasthenia gravis). Maternal drugs. 16.3.1.4 Red Flags Respiratory insufficiency/failure. Developmental regression. 16.3.1.5 Work-up Reflexes are the most important examination maneuver (you can tap a finger to assess a baby’s reflexes) Areflexia indicates a peripheral process and need for non-urgent EMG Present reflexes indicate a central process Next is the presence of appendicular hypertonia, which is an increased resistance to passive stretch (and hyperreflexia) of the limbs despite the axial hypotonia (muscles of the neck and trunk), which can indicate perinatal injury and can be non-urgently assessed w/ MRI Septic work-up, LFTs, ammonia, chemistry, CK, consider genetic work-up 16.3.1.6 Management New therapies for SMA (nusinersen, zolgensma)! Otherwise, depends on etiology. Typically supportive, using EI for children under age 3 or the school for older children w/ emphasis on PT and OT, ST as needed for dysphagia. 16.3.1.7 Complications Dependent on the underlying cause but sometimes associated w/ cognitive dysfunction in addition to developmental delay 16.3.2 Infantile Botulism21 16.3.2.1 Pathophysiology C. botulinum produces toxin that interferes w/ release of acetylcholine at NMJ (disrupts vesicle binding to the pre-synaptic membrane) In infancy, C. botulinum colonizes intestinal tract in situ Contamination of honey or corn syrup, dusty environments near construction/agricultural soil disruption are culprits In adults, paralysis results from ingestion of the toxin 16.3.2.2 Presentation Descending paralysis, often starting w/ ophthalmoplegia (may involve pupillary response), followed by weak cry, dysphagia and progresses to weakness of respiratory muscles 16.3.2.3 Differential GBS Miller Fisher variant, hypermagnesemia, SMA, Myasthenia Gravis 16.3.2.4 Red Flags Weakness of muscles of respiration can indicate need for intubation 16.3.2.5 Work-up Isolation of organism in stool. EMG: short-duration, low-amplitude motor unit potentials. 16.3.2.6 Management ICU care for severe presentation, may require ventilator support Immune globulin Avoid aminoglycosides (produce pre-synaptic neuromuscular blockage) Treat w/ BIG prior to confirmation of stool/EMG if clinical suspicion is high 16.3.2.7 Complications Apnea, respiratory failure, sudden infant death 16.4 Neuroimmunology 16.4.1 Multiple Sclerosis (MS)22 16.4.1.1 Pathophysiology T lymphocytes attack oligodendrocytes, affecting myelin (autoimmune-mediated demyelination); known genetic (HLA subtypes) and environmental (smoking, latitude, vit D) risk factors 16.4.1.2 Presentation Repeated episodes focal deficits (optic neuritis, weakness, numbness) separated in time Imaging often shows lesions separated by space w/i the CNS 16.4.1.3 Differential ADEM (often a first presentation of MS- multiple lesions causing altered sensorium), NMO spectrum disorder (neuromyelitis optica), MOG-antibody associated demyelinating disease, malignancy, nutritional deficiency, leukodystrophy, mitochondrial disorder, CNS vasculitis, ophthalmologic disease 16.4.1.4 Red Flags Presentation is broad and variable Seizure (indicating gray matter involvement), fever should lead you to rethink the diagnosis Weakness of muscles of respiration and/or mental status changes can indicate need for intubation 16.4.1.5 Work-up Definitive diagnosis requires repeated episodes over time LP reveals CSF w/ elevated protein count +/- presence of oligoclonal bands (must be compared w/ serum). MRI is imaging modality of choice. The presence of 3+ white matter lesions on T2 imaging especially if perpendicular to the ventricles sensitive for diagnosis (Dawson’s fingers) 16.4.1.6 Management Acute exacerbations require short-course of steroids. Load w/ methylprednisolone (30 mg/kg; maximum 1g), treat for 3-5 days. Neuroimmunology consult for disease-modifying drugs. 16.4.2 Acute Disseminated Encephalomyelitis (ADEM)23 16.4.2.1 Pathophysiology Central demyelinating disorder, presumed immune-mediated mechanism 16.4.2.2 Presentation Encephalopathy + lethargy, headache, vomiting, focal neurological symptoms 16.4.2.3 Differential Multiple Sclerosis, infectious/toxic/metabolic encephalitis, leukodystrophy 16.4.2.4 Red Flags Decreased level of arousal can indicate need for intubation for airway protection 16.4.2.5 Work-up MRI brain and spine w/ and w/o contrast (T2 weighted MRI reveals confluent increased signal intensity throughout white matter, specifically corpus callosum and periventricular region). LP (CSF can be normal or have elevated protein or WBC). 16.4.2.6 Management High dose IV methylprednisolone; IVIG and plasma exchange may help refractory cases 16.4.2.7 Complications Typically a self-limiting, monophasic course Multiple episodes raise concern for MS/MOG-associated demyelination 16.4.3 Transverse Myelitis24 16.4.3.1 Pathophysiology Combined demyelinating and inflammatory disorder. Wide variety of associations: May present as part of demyelinating disorder (MS, NMO) Associated with various rheum conditions (SLE, RA, scleroderma, etc) Idiopathic cases largely thought to be post-infectious (30-60% preceded by viral illness) 16.4.3.2 Presentation Acute to subacute development (nadir 4 hrs to 21 days) of weakness (commonly UE), sensory deficit, autonomic disturbance. Although initially flaccid, spasticity often follows. Autonomic symptoms include urinary/fecal incontinence, urinary retention, sexual dysfunction. 16.4.3.3 Differential Non-inflammatory: Compressive myelopathy (neoplasm, vertebral body compression fx, spondylosis, herniation); spinal infarct; nutritional deficiencies (B12, vitamin E, NO toxicity) Inflammatory: Demyelinating disease syndrome (MS, ADEM, NMO); rheum disease (SLE, sarcoid, Sjogrens); infections (enterovirus, HIV, WNV, Lyme) 16.4.3.4 Red Flags Rapid onset of paraplegia/spinal shock 16.4.3.5 Work-up Spinal MRI w/wo contrast (T2 hyperintensities; no mass lesion) Brain MRI (r/o central lesions c/w MS) CSF studies (basic + IgG index, oligoclonal bands, cytology, VLDR) abnormal in 50% of cases Expect lymphocytic pleocytosis (children &gt; adults with mean ~136/mm), elevated protein, elevated IgG index Serologies (AQP4, MOG, ANA, Ro/SSA, La/SSB) Infectious studies (HIV, VZV, EBV, VLDR, WNV, enterovirus) B12, MMA 16.4.3.6 Management High dose IV steroids (methylpred 30 mg/kg daily). PLEX if refractory disease or acute motor impairment. Relapsing disease may require long-term immunomodulation (mycophenolate or rituximab). 16.4.3.7 Complications Progression to multiple sclerosis (risk factors include brain MRI abnormalities, oligoclonal bands, mild or asymmetric disease) 16.4.4 Autoimmune Encephalitis (NMDA Receptor Antibody Encephalopathy)25 16.4.4.1 Pathophysiology Antibodies bind to NR1 subunit of NMDAR and cause receptor endocytosis and subsequent neurologic dysfunction Ovarian teratomas are an important cause in girls &lt; 18 (31 %); tumors rare in males Overall, a rare disease 16.4.4.2 Presentation Acute (&lt;3 mos) behavior and personality changes (including depression/anxiety/psychosis), seizures, insomnia, stereotyped movements and autonomic instability 16.4.4.3 Differential Viral encephalitis, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, psychosis, catatonia 16.4.4.4 Red Flags Autonomic instability 16.4.4.5 Work-up MRI Brain typically w/ lesions EEG can show slowing and delta brush ELISA test of Ab against NR1 subunit of NMDA receptor (autoimmune encephalitis panel) is diagnostic Look for tumor w/ US/MRI of abdomen/pelvis 16.4.4.6 Management If applicable, tumor resection Methylprednisolone 30mg/kg (max 1g) IV daily x5d, IVIG 2g/kg over 2 to 5 days and plasma exchange are all first line treatments 16.4.4.7 Complications Autonomic instability, seizures 16.5 Neuropsychiatric 16.5.1 Functional Neurologic Disorder26 16.5.1.1 PowerPlans, Order Sets &amp; Clinical Pathways Other resources: Refer patients to &lt;www.neurosymptoms.org&gt; 16.5.1.2 Pathophysiology Inorganic cause of neurologic symptoms, thought to be due to inappropriate signaling and heightened pain sensation as response to stress 16.5.1.3 Presentation Can present w/ weakness or paralysis, nonepileptic seizures, sensory or somatic complaints Often w/ comorbid anxiety or depression Inconsistencies on exam: Distractibility, inconsistencies between confrontational testing and function, sensory symptoms in non-dermatomal distribution 16.5.1.4 Differential Stroke, GBS, transverse myelitis or other spinal disorder, seizures 16.5.1.5 Red Flags Sudden-onset weakness of one side, dermatomal distribution, spinal level of weakness, areflexia, altered mental status 16.5.1.6 Work-up Thorough history and physical, including medical and psych, review prior labs or imaging, ask about psychological stressors Depends on positive clinical findings rather than negative tests Exam maneuvers Hoover’s sign: involuntary extension of weak leg when contralateral leg flexes against resistance Hip abductor sign: hip abduction weakness in affected leg returns to normal during contralateral hip abduction against resistance of unaffected leg Drift without pronation sign: when asked to hold arms out with palms up and eyes closed, weak arm drifts without pronating (as would be seen with UMN lesions) Arm drop: weak arm held above face and released, will stay suspended or move to miss hitting face, can be tested during non-epileptiform seizures Midline splitting: complete sensory loss on one side, split exactly midline 16.5.1.7 Management PT/OT, psychotherapy, pain management, supportive care, education 16.6 Headache 16.6.1 Migraine 16.6.1.1 PowerPlans, Order Sets &amp; Clinical Pathways Clinical Pathway: Headache/Migraine, Emergent/Urgent 16.6.1.2 Pathophysiology Cortical spreading depression: Neurons fire in a sequential manner across the surface of the brain (causing an aura). Associated w/ irritation and dysregulation of blood vessel tone of the overlying meninges, causing pain. 16.6.1.3 Presentation Unilateral throbbing headache (bilateral sometimes in young children), visual aura, photophobia, phonophobia, nausea, vomiting, relieved by rest 16.6.1.4 Differential Venous sinus thrombosis, concussion, tension type headache, intracranial mass lesion 16.6.1.5 Red Flags Any symptoms suggestive of increased ICP (i.e. papilledema, nerve palsy, positional headache, morning emesis, encephalopathy, wake from sleep w/ headache), focal neurological deficits, change in character from typical headache, progressive worsening of headaches, neck stiffness 16.6.1.6 Work-up Clinical diagnosis, consider MRI for red-flag symptoms 16.6.1.7 Management See treatment algorithm in Migraine Clinical Pathway as above 16.6.2 Tension Headache See Headache section of Neurology Reference Card 16.6.3 Concussion See Sports Medicine chapter 16.6.4 Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (Pseudotumor Cerebri) 16.6.4.1 Pathophysiology Syndrome of increased ICP due to impaired absorption at the arachnoid granulations. Risk factors: obesity, drugs (tetracyclines, retinoids, OCPs) 16.6.4.2 Presentation Patients have frontal, positional HA worse upon awakening Visual disturbances, visual loss, +/- dizziness Examination reveals papilledema 16.6.4.3 Differential Venous sinus thrombosis, intracranial mass lesion, migraine headache, tension headache 16.6.4.4 Work-up MRI/MRV required in children w/ HA and papilledema to rule out mass/hydrocephalus, venous sinus thrombosis. LP w/ elevated opening pressure is diagnostic. 16.6.4.5 Management Acetazolamide 15-25 mg/kg/day (decreases rate of CSF production). Follow-up with Ophtho. 16.6.4.6 Complications Vision loss, optic neuropathy 16.7 Seizures 16.7.1 Febrile Seizure 16.7.1.1 PowerPlans, Order Sets &amp; Clinical Pathways: Clinical Pathway: Seizure, Febrile 16.7.1.2 Pathophysiology Decreased threshold for seizure due to fever and immaturity of the CNS, often familial 16.7.1.3 Presentation Simple: &lt; 15 min, generalized, occurred once in 24 hrs Complex: &gt; 15 min, focal, or occurred &gt; 2 times in a 24 hr period Most commonly seen between 6mo and 6yo, w/ peak presentation between 12-24 mos 16.7.1.4 Differential Meningitis, encephalitis 16.7.1.5 Red Flags AMS, neck stiffness, lethargy, status epilepticus, focal deficits lead to consideration of meningitis/encephalitis 16.7.1.6 Work-up If examination is normal, no further work-up is required 16.7.1.7 Management Reassurance and anticipatory guidance. For complex febrile seizures &gt; 15 minutes, prescribe rectal Diastat. Antipyretics not shown to decrease risk. 16.7.1.8 Complications 30-50% recurrence rate. Minimally increased risk of epilepsy compared w/ the average population, slightly greater for those w/ complex febrile seizures. 16.7.2 First-time Unprovoked Seizure 16.7.2.1 Pathophysiology Typically idiopathic (likely genetic), but sometimes symptomatic from underlying brain lesions 16.7.2.2 Presentation Focal: Unilateral symptoms +/- AMS (dyscognitive vs. cognitive) Generalized: Bilateral tonic clonic movements (GTC), tonic, myoclonus, absence 16.7.2.3 Differential Meningitis, encephalitis, intracranial hematoma, focal lesion (i.e. abscess, AVM, focal cortical dysplasia). 16.7.2.4 Red Flags AMS, neck stiffness, lethargy, focal deficits lead to consideration of meningitis/encephalitis 16.7.2.5 Work-up If examination is normal, no further work-up is required emergently. EEG is next step, as is neurology referral. If the seizure had focal onset or if the EEG shows focality (spikes arising from one portion of the brain), most neurologists opt to do an MRI of the brain w/o contrast. 16.7.2.6 Management Indication for AED therapy is 2 or more unprovoked seizures, or one unprovoked seizure w/ an abnormal EEG. Keppra is often our first line because of both focal and generalized coverage w/ favorable side-effect profile, but we avoid it in cases of children w/ behavioral issues. Neurology admission for patients not returning to baseline following seizure or for multiple seizures upon presentation requiring immediate treatment. 16.7.2.7 Complications Epilepsy for those who go on to have further unprovoked seizures. Rare complication of generalized epilepsy is SUDEP (sudden unexplained death in epilepsy patients). 16.7.3 Breakthrough Seizure (in a patient w/ epilepsy) 16.7.3.1 Pathophysiology Decreased threshold for seizure due to fever, lack of sleep, missed medication dose, alcohol use vs. natural fluctuation of epilepsy (as is the natural history) such that seizures may become more frequent w/o provocation 16.7.3.2 Differential Evaluated potential underlying causes of increased seizure frequency 16.7.3.3 Red Flags AMS, prolonged seizures 16.7.3.4 Work-up Neurology consult for medication adjustment. Before calling, should know the following: Baseline seizure frequency and semiology (what the seizure looks like) vs. current frequency and semiology, doses of all AEDs, most recent levels if available. 16.7.3.5 Management Typically small adjustments to AEDs including addition of AEDs when needed 16.7.4 Infantile Spasms 16.7.4.1 Pathophysiology Varied; can be associated w/ CNS malformations, genetic/metabolic abnormalities, trauma, infections, tuberous sclerosis and other neurocutaneous syndromes, trisomy 21 or may be idiopathic 16.7.4.2 Presentation Spasms involving tonic flexion or extension of neck, trunk, and/or extremities lasting up to 10 sec, can occur in clusters, commonly followed by crying Usually occur during daytime and while awake Usually presents at &lt; 1yo, peak incidence in 3-7mo 16.7.4.3 Differential Exaggerated startle, torticollis, reflux, colic, spasticity, benign myoclonus of infancy, myoclonic epilepsy 16.7.4.4 Work-up EEG: Hypsarrhythmia, MRI, genetic/metabolic labs 16.7.4.5 Management ACTH is first-line, should monitor BP and chem10 while on ACTH Vigabatrin 16.7.4.6 Complications Developmental regression, refractory seizures 16.8 Meningitis 16.8.1 Bacterial Meningitis See ED and ID chapters 16.8.1.1 PowerPlans Fever in infant &lt; 30 days 16.8.1.2 Pathophysiology Bacterial infection of the meninges, caused by hematogenous spread or direct spread from sinuses or mastoids 16.8.1.3 Presentation Fever, headache, vomiting, meningismus, seizures Kernig Sign: Stretching of hamstring w/ knee extension + back pain Brudzinski Sign: passive neck flexion, involuntary hip/knee flexion 16.8.1.4 Differential Viral meningitis/encephalitis, brain abscess, increased ICP, neoplasm, ADEM 16.8.1.5 Red Flags Focal neurological deficits, seizures, papilledema, risk factors for TB (poor clinical outcomes), petechiae on exam (Neisseria) 16.8.1.6 Work-up It’s all about the LP. CSF: WBC count often &gt; 1,000, glucose often &lt; 40 or &lt; half of serum value, protein &gt; 250, cell count w/ &gt; 50% PMNs. Obtain imaging on comatose patients or those w/ focal neurologic deficits PRIOR to LP. 16.8.1.7 Management In addition to abx, dexamethasone used to reduce hearing loss in children 0.15mg/kg q6hr for 2-4 days. See ID chapter for meds/dosing. 16.8.1.8 Complications Seizure, stroke, elevated intracranial pressure 16.8.2 Viral Meningitis &amp; Encephalitis 16.8.2.1 Pathophysiology Viral infection and inflammation of the meninges 16.8.2.2 Presentation Fever, headache, malaise, photophobia, altered mental status 16.8.2.3 Differential HSV (HSV-1 most common in children, HSV-2 most common in neonatal period acquired through maternal transmission), EBV, VZV, CMV (consider if immunocompromised), Eastern Equine Virus, Subacute sclerosis panencephalitis (if remote hx of measles infection), Lyme 16.8.2.4 Red Flags History of immunosuppression/transplant → consider less common organisms 16.8.2.5 Work-up Consider MRI if focal neurologic deficits are present LP should be performed (CSF profile w/ elevated protein and cells, lymphocytic pleocytosis) 16.8.2.6 Management Largely supportive, w/ empiric treatment w/ antibiotics and acyclovir until cultures result HSV → Acyclovir x 14-21 days (&lt;35 wk conceptual age 40 mg/kg/d divided q12; &gt; 35 wk conceptual age 60 mg/kg/d divided q8hr) CMV → Ganciclovir 16.8.2.7 Complications Rarely associated w/ long-term issues; HSV may cause hemorrhage w/i temporal lobes, causing seizures 16.9 References Lehman, et al., Transient focal neurologic symptoms correspond to regional cerebral hypoperfusion by MRI: A stroke mimic in children.

If between 37 0/7 and 37 6/7, chart on Fenton, Olsen and WHO and take better number **“Great pretenders” - risk of resp distress, apnea, temp dysregulation, poor feeding 17.3 Normal Infant Feeding All babies typically lose up to 2-3% of BW/day, should not lose more than 10-12% of BW before discharge. Babies born by c-section may lose more weight than vaginal births (Mom and therefore baby get IV fluids during delivery). Usually start gaining on DOL4. Baby should regain BW by 10-14 days and should gain 20-30g/day for first month, or 5 oz per week (“an ounce a day and time off for weekends”). Babies usually awake for first 5-6 hrs and then sleepy for 24 hrs. Start waking up on DOL2 and are hungry (“all day cafe”). Sometimes if baby is not getting enough with feeds, may shut down and appear sleepy. 17.3.1 Breastfeeding Newborns who are breastfed need to eat every 2-3 hours, on demand. If showing hunger cues, feed, even if just fed. No such thing as newborn “using mother as a pacifier.” Cluster feeding (at breast for several hours) happens on Day 2-3, as baby tries to get milk to come in. Mother may feel tired and frustrated. Reassure that this is NORMAL. Milk usually comes in around 3-5 days. 17.3.1.1 Breastfeeding Tips -Respond to infant feeding cues (early → late: stirring, turning head, mouth opening, hand in mouth, stretching, crying). Infant latch: Line up baby nose to nipple. Stroke baby lips with nipple. Aim nipple to roof of baby’s mouth. Support baby’s neck at the shoulders so head tips back and bring baby onto breast (not breast to baby). &gt;&gt; - Signs of a good latch: lips flanged outward, most of areola hidden in mouth, nose free Breast milk can sit out 8 hrs if freshly pumped, or 5 days in refrigerator. Can store 6-12 mos in freezer. Don’t refreeze thawed breastmilk. Mothers can hand express and/or pump to stimulate milk production. Holding baby skin to skin also stimulates because of hormone release. Hand expression is helpful especially for colostrum or if engorged. Can feed to baby via spoon or syringe. For determining if mom’s meds are safe during breastfeeding: LactMed (part of NIH ToxNet), Hale’s Medications &amp; Mother’s Milk (physical book in BMC workroom or HalesMeds.com. Physical book in BWH nursery) 17.3.1.2 Contraindications to breastfeeding Absolute: infant w/ galactosemia, mom w/ HIV or HTLV-1/2, mom actively using illicit drugs, including marijuana or EtOH (exception: moms in methadone program, see “NAS”), HSV lesion on breast. OK to feed expressed milk: mom w/ varicella or active TB. HCV positive mom ok to breastfeed unless nipples cracked or bleeding. 17.3.2 Formula Feeding Formula fed babies eat every 3-4 hours (if sleeps &gt; 4 hours, wake baby up). Infant stomach is size of a blueberry on DOL1 → lime at DOL7. Volume increases gradually over first several days. DOL1: 10-15 mL per feed, DOL2: 15-30 mL/feed; DOL3: 30-45 mL/feed, DOL4: 45-60 mL/feed. Give baby what last took and if not settled, feed more. Follow baby’s cues. Formula, in 60 mL bottles as supplied by hospital, needs to be consumed within 1 hour of starting feed and then discarded. 17.3.3 Tongue Ties Type Exam Image Mgmt Normal Tongue appears flat and broad Tongue extends over bottom teeth Can swipe finger under tongue uninterrupted N/A N/A Type 4: Mild Posterior tie on tongue, may be submucosal N/A Generally nothing Type 3: Moderate Tie is proximal to 50% of length of tongue Consider lactation consult Type 2: Severe Tie is distal to 50% of length of tongue May create a hump or cupping Frenulectomy if interfering with feeding Type 1: Complete Tie extends to tip of tongue Likely frenulectomy 17.4 Newborn Behavior Infant states: newborn behavior related to state. There are 6 states, all normal. Infant’s ability to self-regulate is related to ability to move fluidly from one state to next, affected by gestational age and perinatal stress. Deep sleep -&gt; light sleep -&gt; drowsy -&gt; active alert -&gt; fussy -&gt; full cry 17.5 Anticipatory Guidance / Discharge Teaching 17.5.1 Feeding feed on demand, only breastmilk or formula, 8-12x in 24h - “8 or more in 24.” Wake up baby after 3-4h to feed. 17.5.2 Normal Voiding / Stooling Should have as many wet diapers as days of life, up to 6-8 after 1 week of life. Should have at least 2-3 stools/day. Color may change, should be yellow, seedy.. Bloody or white stools would be concerning. 17.5.3 Cord Care Keep cord clean (sponge bath), dry, and uncovered by diaper. Will fall off on its own in about 10 days. 17.5.4 Circumcision Care Leave dressing on for 24h. Use petroleum jelly on penis with every diaper change. Written for tylenol x 2 doses in hospital but most babies do not need it and do fine with being skin to skin for comfort. 17.5.5 Safe Sleep Baby should sleep on back in own crib with tight fitted sheet. NO loose blankets, stuffed animals, positioning aids. No propping on side. Swaddling is good. Tuck swaddle blanket under baby, or use velcro swaddler. 17.5.6 Tummy Time Give baby time on tummy. As newborn, can lie on parents chest. Person holding baby should put baby down if feeling sleepy. Don’t sleep with baby. 17.5.7 Consoling Babies cry to communicate. Never shake the baby. Can put baby in crib or pass baby to other caretaker if frustrated. Giving baby hand to suck on and swaddling help with consoling. 17.5.8 Illness Visitors should wash hands before handling baby. Avoid crowds, passing baby among visitors, and people with colds, especially for first few months. Tell older sibs to touch baby’s feet, not hands and face (newborns can’t yet put their feet in mouths). Infant fever (taken rectally) is &gt; 100.4 F: Seek medical attention if baby seems “off”: eating less than usual, making fewer wet diapers, fussy or lethargic. 17.6 Hyperbilirubinemia 17.6.1 Definition Infants ≥ 35 wks GA: TB &gt; 95th percentile (2004 AAP Guidelines/Bhutani nomograms) 17.6.2 Pathophysiology ↑ RBC turnover, ↓ clearance (UGT1A1 activity), ↑ enterohepatic recirculation. Within first 24 hours of life = ALWAYS pathologic. Indirect Direct - ALWAYS pathologic - Breastfeeding jaundice: first week of life due to insufficient feeding and dehydration - Breast milk jaundice: persistent after first week of life, unknown mechanism, ?substance in milk blocks bilirubin breakdown - ABO or Rh incompatibility: suspect if set-up, previous child with hemolytic disease of the newborn, fetal hydrops, jaundice in the first 24 hours of life - Red cell membrane defects (spherocytosis and elliptocytosis) - G6PD deficiency - Sepsis - Decreased clearance – Crigler-Najjar syndrome, Gilbert syndrome - Intestinal obstruction - Anatomic (intestinal obstruction, cysts, tumors, biliary atresia) - Infection/sepsis - Metabolic - Gestational alloimmune liver disease (neonatal hemochromatosis) 17.6.3 Evaluation Healthy infants: Obtain routine transcutaneous bili (TcB) @ DOL2 and plot on bilitool.org . If ABO/Coombs set-up, check TcB @ 12HOL and 24HOL. &gt;&gt; - Determine follow-up frequency based on risk for developing severe hyperbili (use risk zone, which is generated by nomogram + GA + presence of hyperbili risk factors [jaundice in first 24 hours, ABO incompatibility/positive direct Coombs, GA 35-36w, sibling required phototherapy, cephalohematoma, exclusive breastfeeding, East Asian race]) &gt;&gt; - Determine phototherapy threshold based on neurotoxicity risk (use GA + presence of neurotoxicity risk factors [isoimmune hemolytic disease, G6PD, asphyxia, lethargy, temp instability, sepsis/acidosis, albumin &lt;3.0) &gt;&gt;&gt; - If above phototherapy threshold, check total serum bili (TSB). Once TSB is used, TcB may not be used again. Consider checking CBC, retic, hemolysis labs (LDH, haptoglobin, smear), G6PD activity. 17.6.4 Management Reconsider early discharge (before 72 HOL) if bili high intermediate risk. Phototherapy as per BiliTool curves. If near exchange levels: aggressive phototherapy, aggressive hydration (IV+PO). IVIG for isoimmune hemolytic disease. Call blood bank before exchange transfusion 17.7 Infant of a Diabetic Mother (IDM) 17.7.1 Increased risks LGA (BW ≥ 4000g or ≥ 90th percentile for GA) → birth injury (shoulder dystocia, clavicular fracture), preterm birth, RDS/TTN, hypoglycemia (maternal hyperglycemia → infant hyperinsulinism → hypoglycemia; resolves in 2-4d), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (of interventricular septum), hyperbili, polycythemia (Hct &gt; 65% → hyperviscosity → exchange transfusion if symptomatic) 17.7.2 Congenital anomalies Transposition of great arteries, double outlet RV, VSD, truncus arteriosus, hypoplastic L heart syndrome, small L colon syndrome → functional lower bowel obstruction (contrast enema is diagnostic and curative) 17.7.3 Management Obtain glucose at 2-4HOL, then pre-feed until glucoses stabilize. Consider checking Hct in first hours of life. Check Ca++/Mg if jittery or seizure 17.7.4 Hypoglycemia **Glucose (mg/dl) &lt;25 25-39 &gt;=40 Mgmt Admit to NICU and give 2 cc/kg bolus of D10W followed by infusion of D10 - Feed 10-15 mL colostrum / formula and re-check - May give glucose gel 2x (with feed) in first 24 HOL before transferring to NICU - Check 3 pre-feed POC glucoses &lt;= 3 hours apart; if normal, routine care Risk Factors: IDM, LGA, SGA, late preterm or post-term, &lt;2500g, discordant twin, maternal medications (e.g., propranolol) After 48 HOL, glucose levels should be &gt;60 If hypoglycemia persists, send critical labs. Consider diazoxide if hyperinsulinism. 17.8 Neonatal Abstinence Syndrome (NAS) 17.8.1 Pathophysiology Behavioral dysregulation seen 2/2 drug withdrawal in infants chronically exposed in utero to opiods (methadone, buprenorphine, morphine, oxycodone, hydromorphone, heroin) and other substances (nicotines, benzodiazepines, SSRIs).

Uric acid is poorly soluble in water leading to crystal precipitation and deposition in the renal tubules and AKI. Allopurinol competitively inhibits xanthine oxidase, blocking the metabolism of hypoxanthine and xanthine to uric acid. Xanthine is less soluble than uric acid so allopurinol can exacerbate AKI. Cancer cells have ~4X higher Phos than normal cells. Hyperphosphatemia can lead to secondary hypocalcemia and renal calcium phosphate precipitation. Hypocalcemia may also cause cardiac arrhythmias. Elevated uric acid and phosphate worsen the severity of AKI (increases precipitation of each other) 19.5.1.3 Clinical Manifestation Hyperuricemia: Lethargy, nausea, and vomiting Hyperphosphatemia and hypocalcemia: Anorexia, cramping, vomiting, spasm, tetany, seizures, altered consciousness, cardiac arrest Hyperkalemia: Widened QRS; peaked T waves Acute Renal Failure: 2/2 Uric acid and calcium phosphate deposition 19.5.1.4 Diagnostic Studies CBC, Chem 10, LFT’s, LDH, Uric acid → Close attention to K, Ca, Phos, BUN/Cr and LDH Obtain labs (chem 10, uric acid, LFTs) q4-8 hrs depending on severity Urinalysis may show many uric acid crystals but can be normal due to lack of output from the obstructed nephrons Monitor urine output closely 19.5.1.5 Treatment NOTE: Use Onc Tumor Lysis Syndrome Order Set in PowerChart (there is one for rasburicase and one for allopurinol) Hydration: Goal of 3000 mL/m2/day, Consider D5W NS or D5W1/2NS, restrict potassium Benefits unclear for alkalinization of urine (pH 7-8); can consider if appropriate Hyperuricemia: 1st line = Allopurinol: Prevents further UA formation. Competitively inhibits xanthine oxidase, blocking metabolism of hypoxanthine and xanthine to uric acid, does not reduce the preexisting serum uric acid. Do not use if risk of AKI. Rasburicase: Rapidly reduces existing UA. Recombinant version of urate oxidase; leads to degradation of uric acid to allantoin (excreted renally). Consider if Uric acid &gt;5 or unable to hyperhydrate Test for G6PD first. Contraindicated in patients with G6PD deficiency because hydrogen peroxide, a breakdown product, can cause methemoglobinemia and hemolytic anemia. Order “Uric acid, post-rasburicase” (in Order Set) to check levels Hyperkalemia: Calcium gluconate to reduce risk of dysrhythmia. Insulin plus glucose or beta-agonists for quick control. Kayexalate for excretion. Hyperphosphatemia: Hyperhydration Hypocalcemia: IV calcium, careful to not worse calcium phosphate deposition if phos still high. 19.5.2 Fever and Neutropenia 19.5.2.1 Definition (Absolute neutrophil count (ANC) &lt;500 cells/uL OR ANC expected to decrease to &lt;500 cells/uL during the next 48 hours) AND fever &gt; 38.5C once or &gt; 38.0C twice (separated by ≥1 hour) in a 24 h period “Functional neutropenia” refers to patients whose hematologic malignancy results in qualitative defects (impaired phagocytosis and killing of pathogens) of circulating neutrophils (e.g. prior to starting chemo) These patients should also be considered to be at increased risk for infection, despite a “normal” neutrophil count 19.5.2.2 Risk Stratification “High Risk” Population: Patient with prolonged and profound neutropenia (ANC &lt;100/mm3 for &gt;7-10 days) AML in all phases of therapy (except APML maintenance) ALL in all phases of therapy EXCEPT continuation Patients with Down Syndrome with ANY oncologic diagnosis Patients with clinical features of severe infection (i.e. septic shock, typhlitis) “Standard Risk” Population Solid tumor patients (most) ALL: Continuation phase of therapy only Patients with an anticipated duration of profound neutropenia lasting ≤ 7 days 19.5.2.3 Pathogenesis Patients can have absolute or functional leukopenia (secondary to oncologic conditions and/or cytotoxic drugs). Impairs ability of host to defend against invasion by microorganisms. 19.5.2.4 Microbiology Gram-positive infections predominate Coagulase-negative staph, strep pneumo, staph aureus, strep viridans, B. Cereus Risk factor for S. Virdans bacteremia: high-dose IV cytarabine Gram-negative infections are also common Pseudomonas aeruginosa, stenotrophomonas maltophilia, E. coli, Serratia, Klebsiella 19.5.2.5 Clinical Manifestations Fever: Focal source of infection (skin/soft tissue/lungs/etc) Physical exam: Thorough exam assessing for signs of infection including vitals, skin folds, line sites, oropharynx, perineum. Inflammation in neutropenic patients can be subtle. *** NO rectal exam or rectal temperatures *** Typhlitis (neutropenic enterocolitis): Microbial infection leads to necrosis of layers of bowel wall. Cecum typically affected (possibly secondary to diminished vascularization), can also involve ascending color and terminal ileum. Signs/symptoms: Abdominal pain (often RLQ), distention, cramping, nausea/vomiting, watery/bloody diarrhea, hematochezia. If peritoneal signs and shock, consider bowel wall perforation. Work-up: Plain film to r/o free air, Contrast CT, blood and stool cultures, and C. diff assay Diagnosis: CT with contrast demonstrating bowel wall thickening, mesenteric stranding, bowel dilatation, pneumatosis + fever + abdominal pain 19.5.2.6 Diagnostic Studies Labs: CBCd. LFT’s, amylase and lipase if abdominal symptoms. Consider chemistries as clinically relevant (PN dependence, dehydration, etc). Cultures: Anaerobic and aerobic blood cultures should be obtained from each lumen of any indwelling catheters, and a peripheral vein. Obtained q24h for temperature &gt; 38.5C from one lumen thereafter. Urinalysis and urine culture: Clean-catch urine or catheter specimen (if &lt; 2 years, consider catheter specimen) Skin, sputum, throat swabs and cultures as indicated CSF usually not obtained for analysis or culture unless clinically warranted (seizure, change in mental status) Imaging: CXR in patients with respiratory symptoms. KUB with abdominal symptoms. 19.5.2.7 Treatment NOTE: Use Onc Sepsis/F&amp;N Order Set Key Treatment Principles: Empiric antibiotic regimen must provide reliable coverage against Pseudomonas Antipseudomonal coverage must remain active until ANC count recovery (even if a gram positive organism is isolated) Vancomycin rule-out for 48 hours to provide empiric coverage for B. Cereus Antibiotic Discontinuation Criteria ALL, AML (except Continuation phase), Advanced stage Burkitt/B-cell lymphoma Blood cultures negative at 48 hrs Patient well-appearing ANC rising post-nadir: ANC &gt; 200 x 2 days Exception: Febrile at time of new ALL dx, then cultures negative @48-72 hours and afebrile since, can switch to prophylaxis (see below) w/o count recovery per 16-001 All other diagnoses: Blood culture negative at 48 hrs Afebrile x 24 hrs Patient well-appearing Counts rising post nadir and ANC &gt; 200 Discharge patient on oral Augmentin + Ciprofloxacin until ANC &gt; 500.

For ALL, start when in CR. Agents: Bactrim (preferred, dosed 3 days/wk 5mg/kg up to 160mg PO), atovaquone, pentamidine 19.5.2.8.4 Antiviral Patient population: Generally reserved for patients with a h/o HSV infection during prior cycles Agents: Valacyclovir 19.5.3 Anterior Mediastinal Mass &amp; Superior Vena Cava Syndrome 19.5.3.1 Pathogenesis Compression of mediastinal structures by an anterior mediastinal mass leading to upper body venous congestion and airway obstruction 19.5.3.2 Differential For anterior mediastinal masses: “4 T’s” Thyroid mass Thymoma Teratoma (malignant) (Terrible) lymphoma/ T-ALL 19.5.3.3 Clinical Manifestations Cough/dyspnea/wheezing (40-70% of pts). Arm, neck and/or facial swelling (&gt;60%) from decreased blood return, also predisposes to venous clot formation. Plethoric/ruddy facies (13-23%). Also, dysphagia, orthopnea, hoarseness. Symptoms exacerbated when lying supine or valsalva. Headache, anxiety, and altered mental status (secondary to CO2 retention) Increased ICP, can cause life-threatening cerebral edema Pleural effusion present in ~40-60% Shock if cardiopulmonary compromise; pericardial effusion possible 19.5.3.4 Diagnostic Studies Imaging: CXR, thoracic and abdominal CT, echoc (if suspicion for cardiac compromise) and chest ultrasound with Doppler (if suspicion for SVC thrombosis) Labs: CBC, tumor lysis labs, consider tumor marker evaluation, BM aspirate if peripheral blasts present Diagnosis by least invasive method possible to avoid sedation (peripheral lymph node biopsy, bone marrow, pleurocentesis, pericardiocentesis) 19.5.3.5 Management Anesthesia and ORL consult. Consider ICU transfer. Immediate supportive care: O2, elevate HOB to 30 degrees Empiric chemotherapy may be necessary based on specific circumstances Therapy depends on most likely diagnosis, but radiation therapy, steroids, chemotherapy and diuretics are options to consider Surgical resection of chemo/radio-resistant tumors (in rare cases) Anticoagulation as appropriate if SVC syndrome is due to thrombus 19.5.4 Spinal Cord Compression 19.5.4.1 Pathogenesis Epidural compression can result from perivertebral tumors extending through intervertebral foramen as well as bulky metastatic disease in vertebral bodies Most common etiologies: Sarcoma, neuroblastoma, germ cell tumors, lymphoma and CNS metastases Compression of venous plexus leads to cord edema, hemorrhage, and ischemia Prognosis is based on duration of symptoms and time to diagnosis and treatment; in general survival for patients with spinal cord compression is &lt;1 year May occur at any spinal level (15% cervical spine, 60% thoracic spine, 25% lumbosacral spine) 19.5.4.2 Clinical Manifestations Focal back pain in a known oncology patient is considered spinal cord compression until proven otherwise! Back pain (80-90% of patients), weakness (35-75%), paresis, sensory abnormalities, paraplegia or quadriplegia, urinary and/or fecal incontinence, or constipation Prolonged cord compression causes irreversible paralysis, sensory loss and sphincter incompetence 19.5.4.3 Physical Exam Complete neurologic evaluation including rectal tone, with attention to level of deficit and sensory abnormalities Pain is often aggravated by movement, straight-leg raise, neck flexion, recumbency or Valsalva maneuver 19.5.4.4 Diagnostic Studies MRI w/ + w/o gadolinium. Obtain emergently if back pain is associated w/ focal neurologic deficits or refusal/inability to walk Following MRI, consider LP with cytology studies Spine radiographs are generally not helpful (positive in 1/3rd of cases) 19.5.4.5 Treatment Goal is rapid decompression of tumor Dexamethasone load 1-2 mg/kg, then 0.25– 0.5mg/kg IV q6hr (children) or 10mg IV bolus (adolescents/adults) followed by 6mg q6hr Consult Neurosurgery to evaluate for surgical decompression and laminectomy Consult Radiation Oncology to evaluate for emergent XRT Chemotherapy may be helpful in select tumors if specific tumor type is known or highly suspected and is likely therapy-responsive (e.g. lymphoma, neuroblastoma) Surgical resection may be best option if tumor type unknown or if mass persists despite radiotherapy, steroids, and/or chemotherapy 19.5.5 Hyperleukocytosis &amp; Leukostasis 19.5.5.1 Definition Definition varies by disease. Occurs more commonly with AML (10-20%) and very rarely in ALL. AML: WBC &gt;100,000 ALL: WBC &gt;300,000 Chronic phase CML: WBC &gt;600,000 19.5.5.2 Pathogenesis Increased blood viscosity as a direct complication of a large population of leukemic blasts that are less deformable than mature leukocytes White blood cell plugs in the microvasculature causing symptoms of decreased tissue perfusion This causes local hypoxia, and can lead to increased production of cytokines, resulting in endothelial damage 19.5.5.3 Clinical Manifestations Neurological: Visual changes, headache, dizziness, tinnitus, gait instability, confusion, somnolence, and, occasionally, coma Increased risk of intracranial hemorrhage (persists for at least a week after the reduction of white cell count) Pulmonary: Dyspnea, hypoxia, possible diffuse interstitial or alveolar infiltrates on imaging studies Occasionally, patients develop dyspnea and worsening hypoxemia following the initiation of chemotherapy due to the lysis of leukemic cells trapped in the lungs (eg, acute lysis pneumopathy) Note: Measured arterial pO2 can be falsely decreased in patients with hyperleukocytosis, since the WBCs in the test tube utilize oxygen. Pulse oximetry provides a more accurate assessment of O2 saturation in this setting ID: ~80% of patients with leukostasis are febrile, which may be due to inflammation associated with leukostasis or infection 0 Other: Less common signs or symptoms include electrocardiographic signs of myocardial ischemia or right ventricular overload, worsening renal insufficiency, priapism, acute limb ischemia, or bowel infarction 19.5.5.4 Physical Exam Careful neurologic exam including fundoscopic exam 19.5.5.5 Diagnostic Studies Labs: CBCd, tumor lysis labs (see above), coagulation panel Measured arterial pO2 can be falsely decreased because WBCs in the test tube utilize oxygen. Pulse oximetry will be more accurate. 0 Imaging: CXR and/or non-contrast head CT/MRI for neurologic abnormalities 19.5.5.6 Treatment Supportive care: This is the most important initial treatment Hyperhydration Close monitoring for DIC (especially AML &amp; APML patients) Maintain platelets &gt;20K given bleeding risk Judicious use of pRBC transfusion as this increases viscosity Leukapheresis: Variable implementation as a clear benefit for patient outcome is not established. Generally, may be considered as an option for WBC &gt;100,000, more common in AML than ALL. - Contraindications may include hemodynamic instability (may be worsened by leukapheresis), patient unable to have central access, cardiovascular comorbidities Low dose-chemotherapy: For cytoreduction purposes Generally “pre-induction” therapy with cytarabine or hydroxyurea May rapidly lower WBC count and cause tumor lysis syndrome 19.5.6 Increased ICP 19.5.6.1 Definition Normal ICP values vary w/ age but are generally 5-10 mmHg in infants and 10-15 mmHg in adolescents/adults. Symptoms generally when ICP &gt;20 mmHg, though this can vary with age. 19.5.6.2 Pathogenesis Blockage of CSF flow, usually by compression of the third of fourth ventricle by an infratentorial tumor 19.5.6.3 Clinical Manifestations Infants: Oersonality/behavior changes, head holding or banging, vomiting, lethargy, loss of milestones, seizures, increased head circumference, bulging fontanelle, distension of scalp veins, strabismus Older children: Headache (classically in the morning and occipital), vomiting (often without nausea), diplopia, ataxia, hemiparesis, dizziness, lethargy, speech disturbances, neck stiffness and coma 19.5.6.4 Physical Exam Vital signs: Classic Cushing’s triad hypertension (systolic with widened pulse pressure), irregular respirations and bradycardia (late sign of increased ICP) Physical eam: Complete neurologic exam with attention to mental status and cranial nerves Classic herniation syndromes: Transtentorial: Ipsilateral papillary dilation +/- contralateral hemiparesis Foramen magnum: Depressed LOC, Cushing’s triad 19.5.6.5 Diagnostic Studies Labs: None needed. Do not obtain LP given risk of herniation! Imaging: Emergent CT or MRI 19.5.6.6 Treatment NOTE: See Critical Care chapter for detailed management Goals are to maintain cerebral perfusion, control ICP and prevent herniation or seizures Transfer to ICU; involve Neurosurgery Neuroprotective measures: Elevate HOB 30 degrees, maintain normothermia &amp; normoglycemia, keep patient calm 3-5cc/kg bolus of 3% hypertonic saline 0.5-1g/kg bolus of mannitol Hyperventilation to reduce CO2 in severe cases Intubation if concern for respiratory abnormalities !onc card 1 !onc_card_2 "],
["pain.html", "Chapter 20 Pain 20.1 Chronic Pain 20.2 Acute Pain 20.3 Cancer Pain Management", " Chapter 20 Pain 20.1 Chronic Pain 20.1.1 Complex Regional Pain Syndrome (CRPS) 20.1.1.1 Management Aggressive physical therapy (desensitization is the mainstay, but can use a block to facilitate physical therapy), avoiding immobilization at all cost, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), medications (see below adjuncts) 20.1.2 Sickle Cell Disease 20.1.2.1 Management Can have ACUTE (acute chest, vaso occlusive episodes) and CHRONIC components Management of ACUTE episodes is opiate driven. See section below for common dosing strategies and delivery methods. For opiate sparing in acute episodes, can add ketamine infusions and regional blocks Max dose ketamine infusion is 6 mcg/kg/min, typically starts at 3 mcg/kg/min Side effects of ketamine infusions can be hallucinations at high doses Management of CHRONIC episodes is driven by CBT, PT, avoidance of triggers of further acute episodes, and neuropathic pain medications to manage neuropathic pain components (such as gabapentin, duloxetine) 20.1.3 Adjunct Pain Medications Often Used in Chronic Pain Duloxetine (SSNRI directed towards neuropathic pain symptoms) Magnesium Lidocaine patches Voltaren gel (NSAID gel to be used topically on area of pain) Ketorolac Gabapentin (neuropathic pain) Clonidine Baclofen (muscle relaxant) Tizanidine (muscle relaxant) 20.2 Acute Pain 20.2.1 Post-Surgical Pain Opiates in form of PCA or rescue doses Nerve blocks w/ catheters, typically for extremity surgeries: Differentiate between compressible and non-compressible nerve blocks: Compressible: Interscalene, TAP, intercostal, femoral, adductor canal, sciatic, popliteal fossa Non-compressible: Supraclavicular, retroclavicular, infraclavicular, paravertebral, lumbar plexus 20.2.2 Acute Infectious Pain Abdominal sources (e.g. appendicitis, acute cholecystitis): Pain is typically managed w/ combo of non-opiates (NSAIDs, acetaminophen) and opiates Be wary of NSAID-induced gastritis and opiate-induced constipation Soft tissue sources (e.g. necrotizing fasciitis, burns, cellulitis) 20.2.3 Acute Sickle Cell Pain See above under Chronic Pain section 20.3 Cancer Pain Management 20.3.1 Patient-Controlled Analgesia (PCA) NOTE: Use order sets! 20.3.1.1 PCA Notation PCA notation: e.g. morphine PCA for 15kg pt → 0.375mg/12min/0.225mg/hr/1.5mg/hr This means bolus dose is 0.375mg, the patient or nurse can deliver it every 12 minutes maximum (lock-out), and the continuous rate is 0.225mg/hr, with a max hourly rate of 1.5mg/hr 20.3.1.2 PCA Dosing Morphine PCA Standard bolus dose 0.025mg/kg (usual max 1.8mg) Usual lock-out of 7-12 minutes Usual continuous 0.015mg/kg/hr Max dose 1mg/hr (you don’t need to have a continuous rate) Max hourly dose rate calculated as 0.1mg/kg Hydromorphone PCA Standard bolus dosing 0.005mg/kg, usual max of 0.3mg Usual lock out 7-12 minutes Continuous 0.003mg/kg/hr (usual max 0.2mg/hr) Hourly dose limit 0.02mg/kg Fentanyl PCA 0.25mcg/kg (usual max 18mcg) Lock out 7-12 minutes Continuous dose 0.15mcg/kg/hr Hourly dose limit 1mcg/kg. 20.3.2 Neuraxial Catheters with Pump 20.3.2.1 Intrathecal vs. epidural catheters: Intrathecal catheter: The catheter sits beyond the pia mater, inside the same area as the spinal cord. Typically only used for end-of-life pain, often will cause a dense motor block. Narrow therapeutic index. Epidural catheter: The catheter sits in the epidural space right above the dura mater. Used for post-operative pain (lumbar epidural for lower abdominal or pelvic procedures, thoracic epidural for thoracic or large abdominal procedures), as well as for cancer pain. Often able to achieve a strictly sensory block, though motor block common w/ lumbar epidurals. 20.3.2.2 How to check a level Ice: Place ice on areas of different dermatomes below the block site; when the patient feels that the sensation is less cold compared to an area above the block or on the arm, you have the area of your block. Check bilaterally, as one-sided blocks can be common with epidurals. Checking a level w/ ice will show you the earliest onset of a block, as temperature is blocked before pain. Pinprick: Using cocktail sword, blunt needle, or twisted up alcohol wipe wrapper, poke areas of different dermatomes below the level of the suspected block. Ask for any difference in sensation to a poke above the level of the block or on an arm. 20.3.2.3 Notation for patient- or nurse-controlled epidural anesthesia e.g. Bupivacaine 0.125% running at 6/2/20/12 This means that the epidural is infusing 0.125% bupivacaine at a rate of 6cc/hr, with a 2cc bolus that the patient can give themselves every 20min (also called a 20min lock-out), for a total hourly dose max of 12cc 20.3.2.4 Common neuraxial questions from nursing Hypotension Due to blocked sympathetic activity causing vasodilation; or, if intrathecal catheter and level too high, due to inhibition of cardiac accelerator fibers and bradycardia paired with vasoplegia More common w/ intrathecal than epidural catheters, and more common w/ thoracic than lumbar epidurals Steps to interrogate: Pause the pump, check a level. If too high, keep the pump off. If appropriate, consider fluid bolus or decreasing rate of local anesthetic or concentration of local anesthetic. Motor block Occurs more commonly w/ intrathecal catheters, or lumbar vs. thoracic epidurals If occurring and not desired, call the Pain Service Fluid under tegaderm covering catheter site Possibly due to catheter migration, can also be due to sweat Steps to interrogate: Check numbers on catheter to see if matches the procedure note; if the catheter has been displaced, contact the Pain Service. Also check to see if the patient still has a level, indicating a likely functioning block. Catheter inadvertent removal Call post-operative Pain Service. Make note of whether patient is on anticoagulation and timing of last dose if so, they will want to know! "],

For infants &lt;6 mos, initial per-kg doses begins at 25% of the above per-kg doses. All doses approximate; adjust according to clinical circumstances.* 21.3.1.3 KEY TIPS: Prescribing Opioids Prescribe a bowel regimen that includes a stool softener AND laxative (“mush and push!”) When speaking with patients and families, use the term “opioid” (a medical term) rather than “narcotic” (a legal/regulatory term) Reassure families that their child will not become a “drug addict” on the appropriate opioid regimen. Educate them on the difference between addiction and dependence Increase opioid dose based on clinical response; the “right dose” is the dose that best controls pain with the fewest side effects. Dose increases are based on a percentage of the current dose: 30% increase for mild pain 50% increase for moderate pain 75-100% increase for severe pain If discharging a patient with opioids, consider prescribing naloxone in the event opioid is misused and overdose occurs 21.3.1.4 KEY TIPS: Breakthrough Pain (BTP) BTP is a transitory flare of moderate to severe pain that occurs on a background of otherwise adequately controlled pain. BTP is different from end-of-dose failure (EDF). EDF is pain at the end of a dosing interval of an ATC analgesic. For BTP: increase daily dose of opioid by 50-100% of the total amount of breakthrough medication given in past 24 hrs. Each subsequent dose of the breakthrough opioid should equal 10-15% of the total daily opioid requirement. Equianalgesic Conversions | Opioid | PO (mg) | IV/SQ (mg) | |—————|———|—————| | Morphine | 30 | 10 | | Oxycodone | 20 | n/a | | Hydromorphone | 7.5 | 1.5 | | Fentanyl | n/a | 0.1 (100 mcg) | 21.3.1.5 Sample Opioid Calculations Same Opioid, Changing the Route: Ex: 90 mg q12hr SR morphine PO -&gt; morphine IV infusion - Calculate 24 hr dose: 90 mg q12 * 2 = 180 mg PO/24 hrs - Use PO to IV equianalgesic ratio: 30 mg PO = 10 mg IV - Use ratios to calculate new dose: 180/x = 30/10; x= (180*10)/30 = 60 mg IV/24hr = 2.5 mg/hr IV infusion Changing the Opioid (Equianalgesic Conversion) Ex: 90 mg q12hr SR morphine PO -&gt; hydromorphone PO - Calculate 24 hr dose: 90 mg q12 * 2 = 180 mg PO/24 hrs - Use equianalgesic ratio: 30 mg morphine PO = 7.5 mg hydromorphone PO - Use ratios to calculate dose of new opioid: 180/x = 30/7.5; x = (1807.5)/30 = 45 mg hydromorphone PO/24 hr Reduce dose by 25-30% to account for cross-tolerance: 45 0.3 = 13.5; 45 mg-13.5mg=32 mg/24 hr (or about 5 mg q4hr) 21.3.1.6 Proper Use of Naloxone Opioid antagonists can reverse opioid-induced respiratory depression; however, they also may reverse analgesic effects. Naloxone should NOT be administered for a depressed RR but normal O2 saturation, or for a patient who is arousable. In either of those cases, simply reduce the opioid dose, provide physical stimulation, and continue to monitor the patient closely. If naloxone is needed: dilute 0.4 mg (1 ml) in 9 ml of NS, and give IV in 1-2 ml increments at 2-3 min intervals until response If administered, be prepared for analgesia to be reversed 21.3.1.7 Adjuvant Agents: Primary purpose is typically not analgesic, yet they may relieve pain. Adjuvants Comments Tricyclics: Nortriptyline May cause anticholinergic effects (amitriptyline &gt; nortriptyline) constipation, dry mouth, postural hypotension. Can also prolong QT Gabapentanoids: Gabapentin Pregabalin Titrate up gradually to prevent dizziness or drowsiness α-agonist: Clonidine Acts as an opioid sensitizer, can reduce withdrawal symptoms. May have synergistic sedative and respiratory effects with opioids Antispasmodics: Baclofen Diazepam Baclofen may cause dizziness, drowsiness, constipation, confusion; rarely seizures or hallucinations Diazepam can cause drowsiness; relieves myoclonus (neurotoxicity) from opioids. synergistic sedative and respiratory effects with opioids NSAIDS: Celecoxib Celecoxib is a selective COX-2 inhibitor with little platelet inhibition (= less bleeding risk) than other NSAIDs 21.3.2 COMMUNICATING EFFECTIVELY 21.3.2.1 KEY TIPS: Language Instead of Saying: Try Saying: “Our hypoplast” or “CF-er” “The child with hypoplastic left heart disease”; “The young man living with CF” “Your child failed the treatment plan” “Our treatments were not successful in curing your child” “I know how you feel”, or “I know how difficult this situation is for you” “I can only imagine how difficult this situation is for you” “Do you want us to do everything”? “What is your understanding of the decision to attempt life-sustaining interventions?” “Are you ready to sign the Do Not Resuscitate (DNR) orders?” Do you agree with the medical recommendation for a “Do Not Attempt Resuscitation” (DNAR) order for your child? “We are going to withdraw support” or “We will be pulling the ventilator now” “We will stop mechanical ventilation, but will continue to provide maximal efforts to manage your child’s symptoms” 21.3.2.2 Managing Emotion (NURSE mnemonic) One of the most important skills in difficult conversations. When emotion is running high, before moving forward with the conversation, do the following: Name the emotion (“It sounds like you’re really frustrated.”) Understand the core message (“If I understand you correctly, you are worried that…”) Respect: (“I’m really impressed that you’ve taken care of Steven at home for so long.”) Support: (I will do my best to be sure that you have what you need.”) Explore: (“Could you say more about what you mean when you say that…?”) 21.3.2.3 Discussing Goals of Care Goals of care are different for everyone. The only way to understand a child/family’s goals of care is to ASK. Goals of care may include: physical and psychological comfort; attending prom, graduation, or other important events; speaking; eating favorite foods; sleeping in own bed at home. Important questions to ask: What do you expect in the future? What are the most important things that you are hoping for your child right now? What are you most worried about? 21.3.2.4 Sharing Difficult News Establish a shared agenda Ask family about their current understanding of situation Provide succinct medical update Forecast the medical possibilities; consider presenting worst, best, and most likely scenarios As patient/family their goals and hopes in light of the information Offer a medical recommendation based on the medical situation and the goals of care of the patient and family Offer resources to help the family think through options (social worker, chaplaincy, Courageous Parents Network videos on the web). Lay out the plan, including a time to meet again. 9.Document discussion. 21.3.2.5 Discussing Life-Sustaining Therapies (LST) Avoid mechanical descriptions of CPR, such as “starting the heart” or “putting on a breathing machine.” Use neutral, non-judgmental language to describe options; for instance, avoid describing cardiac resuscitation in terms of broken ribs and painful electroshock. Avoid saying, “Do you want us to do everything?” Many families believe CPR WILL restore their child to their baseline. It is helpful to describe it as an ATTEMPT to reverse death. Use of the word “die” also helps to clarify this. Talking About the Role of LST: Sample Language We all share the hope that your child will live as long as possible. But that is usually not the only goal. We also want your child to live as well as he possibly can, and some of the treatments that we use to extend life may alter his quality of life in ways that may not be what you would wish for him. If the time comes when critical decisions need to be made, you will have more control over the situation if we all understand and agree about what is most important for you and your child. Talking about these possibilities does not mean that we are giving up – we think of this strategy as hoping for the best, but planning for the worst. In case your child does not get better, what are you hoping for? 21.3.3 CARING FOR A CHILD FACING END OF LIFE 21.3.3.1 BEFORE the Child’s Death: If there is a possibility that a child may die during your shift, introduce yourself to the child and family as soon as you arrive. Familiarize yourself with the child’s history by speaking with the child’s nurse and/or other caregivers. Involve chaplaincy, child life, and other supportive services based on family preferences. Determine whether autopsy and organ donation have been discussed with the family. If not, address these issues with the family. If they agree, obtain informed consent. 21.3.3.2 KEY TIPS: Organ Donation Donation is not limited to whole organs; families may choose to donate specific tissues, such as corneas, heart valves, pericardium, bone, veins, or skin. Call the New England Organ Bank (NEOB) at 1-800-446-6362 to determine eligibility and discuss procurement logistics before donation is offered to the family. 21.3.3.3 AT the Time of Death: If you did not know the child prior to death, familiarize yourself with the child’s history before speaking with the family. Consider asking the child’s nurse to introduce you to the family and provide additional support. In the Room: Introduce yourself to the family, including your role and your relationship to the deceased child. Express your sympathy, and allow the family to express their emotions before beginning. Explain that you are going to examine their child. Reassure the family that they may stay if they wish. Pronouncement: Identify the patient by his or her hospital ID band. Ensure that the patient does not rouse to verbal or tactile stimuli. Avoid painful and unnecessary stimuli. Listen and feel for the absence of heart sounds and of pulse. Look and listen for the absence of spontaneous respirations. Note the position of the pupils and the absence of pupillary light reflex. 21.3.3.4 AFTER the Child’s Death: Autopsy and Organ Donation (If not discussed prior) Notify the New England Organ Bank (NEOB): Massachusetts mandates that the NEOB be notified for all hospital deaths. Call 1-800-446-6362 within 1 hour of death to inform the NEOB of the family’s wishes regarding donation. Notify Massachusetts Medical Examiner (ME): Call 1-617-267-6767. This is legally mandated for all deaths of children &lt;18 years, including anticipated home deaths +/- hospice. Documentation: Date/time of death; presence of family at time of death; physical exam findings; date/time of physical assessment of patient; family and attending physician notified; family accepts/declines autopsy and/or organ donation; New England Organ Bank notified; Medical Examiner notified. Notify the attending physician and other relevant clinicians Report of Death: The physician who pronounced the patient must complete the “Report of Death” form and bring it to the Admitting Department (or the Emergency Dept during off-hours). Sign the Certificate: Provide your pager number, so that you may be reached later to sign the typed Death Certificate. 21.3.3.5 Writing a Condolence Note Name the deceased and acknowledge the loss. Express your sympathy, using words that remind the bereaved that they are not alone in their feelings of sadness and loss. Avoid statements such as I know how you feel Note those special qualities or characteristics that you appreciated about the person. Recall a memory about the person, and capture what it was about the person in the story that you admired. Humor is ok – funny stories are often appreciated. Remind the bereaved of their personal strengths (patience, optimism, faith, resilience) that will help them to cope. Offer help during this difficult time, and be specific about your offer. Never make an offer that you cannot fulfill. End your letter with a phrase of sympathy: e.g. “You are in my thoughts” Online PPC Resources - PACT webpage on the BCH internal website - Fast Facts: https://www.mypcnow.org/fast-facts/ - Vital Talk (communication): https://www.vitaltalk.org - For confirming opioid calculations and conversions:GlobalRPH.com has a helpful opioid calculator Medical Disclaimer The information contained on this reference card is provided as a supplemental resource and guide.

Assessment: _ is a _ y/o M/F w/ PMH __ who presents w/ concerning __ SI that makes him/her unsafe for discharge home. S/He has been medically cleared and is awaiting placement at an inpatient psychiatric facility. We will continue to provide a safe environment and follow along w/ Psychiatry. Plan: – Medical clearance - Utox, urine HCG - EKG (document baseline QTc) – Behavioral plan - Supervision: 1:1 sitter vs. security, safety tray, safety check prior to any room changes - Activity level: Start w/ confined to room (Psych will decide when out-of-room privileges are ok, e.g. supervised walks around unit or visit to playroom at RN’s discretion - Electronics: Start w/ no phone or internet (Psych will decide if/when permitted and w/ what level of supervision/restrictions) – Agitation plan, per Psychiatry on [date] - Mild agitation: Utilize behavioral strategies - Moderate agitation: Ativan OR Haldol , ALWAYS WITH Benadryl . Call BRT to help prevent further escalation to severe agitation. - Severe agitation: Olanzapine PO/IM (Zydis ODT for PO) OR Haldol PO/IM , ALWAYS WITH Benadryl PO/IM PRN. Call 5-5555 to activate Behavioral Rapid Response (summons Psych, BRT, Security). Call on-call Psych if requires IM or if not responding within 20-30min or if need further guidance. - If administering antipsychotics, daily EKG to monitor QTc (target &lt; 450) - PO’s should be ordered as PRNs, IM must be one-time in the moment and can only be ordered by PGY2 or higher – Dispo: pending placement to inpatient psych when available bed identified Note: dosing for agitation meds is written as __ mg q_ NTE __ from all sources in 24hrs. Dosing recommendations per table below: 23.3 Agitation 23.3.1 Identifying Agitation Mild: Pacing, worrying, agitated but cooperative Moderate: Swearing, threatening, yelling, screaming, clenching fists, pacing, superficial self-injury, request for meds Severe: Imminent risk of harm to self or others, aggression to others/self, destruction of property 23.3.2 Non-Pharm Management BRT is your best friend! 23.3.2.1 Prevention Identifying triggers: - Stimuli that trigger upsetting feelings or problematic behaviors (precipitant to behavior) - Environmental or emotional Patients at risk: ASD, developmental delay, trauma Think about the 4 functions of any behavior: Attention, escape, sensory, tangibles/access 23.3.2.2 Ways to respond Recognize and respond to initial signs of agitation or inappropriate behavior w/ redirection. Avoid using the word “no.” Avoid non-specific comments such as “behave” or “calm down” Ignore behavior that is disruptive, but not harmful. Make a blank non-smiling face, avoid eye contact and turn away. As soon as the child stops the unwanted behavior, smile and make eye contact. Give the child a space - somewhere calm and safe - where they can go when they feel overwhelmed. Do not simply react; try to understand the reasons behind the behavior. 23.3.2.3 Managing the situation Managing the situation Start by asking “what do you want?” Try the SAVE mnemonic: Support ”Let’s work together…”, Acknowledge “I see this has been hard for you.”, Validate ”I’d probably be reacting the same way if I was in your shoes.”, Emotion naming ”You seem upset.” or similar communication efforts when talking with the patient. Strategies will differ based on degree of agitation: Mild Listen, validate, problem-solve Stay w/ the patient, have them sit w/ you Maintain calm demeanor Eliminate distractions Empathic listening Utilize supportive eye and verbal communication, gestures, posture, and facial expressions Utilize preferred activities (eg music) Moderate Redirect, problem-solve Allow individual to vent Validate feelings Severe Direct, clear communication Call 5-5555 to activate Behavioral Rapid Response (summons Psych, BRT, Security) Maintain safe distance (4ft); intervene if danger is imminent Interrupt individual’s focus Body language techniques Positive verbal command Throwing/dropping an object Moving as an escape technique Medications (PO vs. IM), potential need for restraint. 23.3.3 Restraints Ordering restraints for violent or self-destructive/injurious behavior: - CANNOT be written PRN! Appropriate restraint order must be placed immediately upon initiation of restraint. - Ordering clinician must perform face-to-face within 1hr - Order cannot be written by an intern, must be junior/senior resident 23.3.4 Pharmacologic Management See A/P Template section above, as well as Rapid Reference chapter Psychiatry will determine an appropriately tailored pharmacologic agitation plan, but these guidelines are a good starting place if you don’t yet have a formal plan in place: 23.3.4.1 Medication Recommendations - Moderate Agitation Parenteral medication orders for agitation may not be ordered PRN. Place 1 time orders at the time the medication is needed. Parameter Child (weighing 25-50 kg) Adolescent (weighing &gt; 50 kg) Preferred Agent(s) Diphenhydramine or Lorazepam Diphenhydramine or Lorazepam Administration Route For escalating patients who refuse PO and for whom there is significant concern for imminent and serious risk of harm to self or others, please progress to severe agitation IM plan below. IM medications usually require physical holds or restraints and should only be involuntarily administered if there is significant risk of harm PO PO Initial Dosing Diphenhydramine 25 mg or Lorazepam 0.5 - 1 mg Diphenhydramine 50 mg or Lorazepam 1- 2 mg Repeat dosing (60 minutes after initial dose if ineffective) Diphenhydramine 25 mg or Lorazepam 0.5 - 1 mg Diphenhydramine 25 mg or Lorazepam 1 – 2 mg Subsequent Frequency Q4 – 6 hours Not to exceed 100 mg of diphenhydramine or 2 mg of lorazepam in 24 hours Q4 – 6 hours Not to exceed 150 mg of diphenhydramine or 4 mg of lorazepam in 24 hours PO’s should be ordered as PRNs, IM must be one-time in the moment and can only be ordered by PGY2 or higher Prescribers to use discretion and order lower or higher doses as appropriate. 23.3.4.2 Medication Recommendations - Severe Agitation Parenteral medication orders for agitation may not be ordered PRN. Place 1 time orders at the time the medication is needed. Parameter Child (weighing 25-50 kg) Adolescent (weighing &gt; 50 kg) Preferred Agent(s) Olanzapine* (ODT for PO) or Haloperidol and Diphenhydramine** or Lorazepam Olanzapine* (ODT for PO) or Haloperidol and Diphenhydramine** and/or Lorazepam Administration Route PO or IM PO or IM Initial Dosing Olanzapine 2.5 mg or Haloperidol 2 mg and Diphenhydramine 25 mg or Lorazepam 0.5-1 mg Olanzapine 5 mg (can use 7.5mg for patients weighing &gt; 70kg) or Haloperidol 5 mg and Diphenhydramine 50 mg and/or Lorazepam 1-2 mg (can use Haloperidol, Diphenhydramine and Lorazepam combined for patients weighing &gt; 70kg) Repeat dosing (45 minutes after initial dose if ineffective***) Olanzapine 2.5 mg or Haloperidol 1 mg and Diphenhydramine 25 mg or Lorazepam 0.5-1 mg Olanzapine 5 mg or Haloperidol 2.5 mg and Diphenhydramine 25 mg and/or Lorazepam 1-2 mg Subsequent Frequency Q4hr Do not exceed: Olanzapine 10 mg in 24 hours Haloperidol 5 mg in 24 hours Diphenhydramine 100 mg in 24 hours Lorazepam 3 mg in 24 hours Q4hr Do not exceed: Olanzapine 15 mg in 24 hours Haloperidol 10 mg in 24 hours Diphenhydramine 150 mg in 24 hours Lorazepam 6 mg in 24 hours Do NOT use IM olanzapine within 4 hours of IM/IV lorazepam due to risk of cardiopulmonary depression. ODT = orally disintegrating tablet. ** Use of diphenhydramine with haloperidol is preferred to haloperidol alone to avoid risk of acute dystonic reactions. The use of haloperidol in combination with Fluoxetine (Prozac) or Citalopram (Celexa) can significantly increase the risk of QT prolongation and should only be used if benefits outweigh the risks. Consult formulary for complete information. *** If pharmaceutical interventions are not effective, patients at risk for self-harm or harming others may require physical restraints, turning off the lights and an urgent psychiatry evaluation. The use of haloperidol in combination with Fluoxetine (Prozac) or Citalopram (Celexa) can significantly increase the risk of QT prolongation and should only be used if benefits outweigh the risks. 23.4 Medications That Cause Psychiatric Side Effects 23.4.1 Selected Meds Steroids: Aggressiveness/agitation, mania, depression, anxiety, psychosis Procainamide, quinidine: Confusion, delirium Albuterol: Anxiety, confusion Isoniazid: Psychosis Tetracycline: Depression Nifedipine, verapamil: Depression Cimetidine: Depression, confusion, psychosis 23.4.2 Psychosis Sympathomimetics, analgesics, antibiotics (e.g. isoniazid, antimalarials), anticholinergics, anticonvulsants, antihistamines, corticosteroids, antiparkinsonian agents. 23.4.3 Agitation/Confusion/Delirium Benzos, antipsychotics, anticholinergics, antihistamines, antidepressants, antiarrhythmics, antineoplastics, corticosteroids, NSAIDs, antiasthmatics, antibiotics, antihypertensives, antiparkinsonian agents, thyroid hormones 23.4.4 Depression Antihypertensives, antiparkinsonian agents, corticosteroids, calcium channel blockers, NSAIDs, antibiotics, peptic ulcer drugs. 23.4.5 Anxiety Sympathomimetics, antiasthmatics, antiparkinsonian agents, hypoglycemic agents, NSAIDs, thyroid hormones. 23.4.6 Sedation/Poor concentration Antianxiety agents/hypnotics, anticholinergics, antibiotics, antihistamines. 23.5 Capacity Assessment Capacity vs competency: Capacity is a one-time assessment by a clinician. Competency is a legal decision based on accumulated evidence that requires court hearing/proceeding. Patient (18yo+)/family must… Assessment Communicate a clear and stable choice Ask patient to indicate a choice. Frequent reversals may indicate lack of capacity. Understand relevant information Ask patient to explain their understanding of the information given by physician (diagnosis, prognosis, proposed intervention, risks/benefits of intervention and alternatives, including no intervention) Appreciate the situation and its consequences Manage the information in a rational manner Does patient weigh risks/benefits logically? Is there true imminent risk? EX: patient indicating they are suicidal but meet all 4 criteria above. 23.6 Depression &amp; Anxiety 23.6.1 Diagnosis Major Depressive Episode: 2 wks of: Depressed mood (or irritability, which is more common in children) OR anhedonia, PLUS 4+ of remaining SIGECAPs (Sleep change, Interest loss, Guilt/worthlessness, Energy loss/fatigue, Cognition/concentration, Appetite change, Psychomotor change, SI) - Ddx: Hypoactive type (wax/wane, acute-onset, possibly 2/2 underlying medical illness or iatrogenic), adjustment disorder (needs psychotherapy only), delirium 23.6.2 Management According to TADS and CAMS (2 large RCTs w/ govt oversight), combination therapy of SSRI + CBT is superior to monotherapy w/ either! CBT or SSRI is superior to placebo. No SSRI-associated suicidal events in either study, but when initiating SSRI it is important to monitor carefully (wks 1-4: weekly; wks 5-12: every other week) for any signs of ↑ suicidality - NEVER prescribe paroxetine (Paxil) to adolescents (black box warning for suicide) SSRIs are 1st line: Help ⅔ of pts in first trial over 4-8 wks. ⅔ of nonresponders respond to 2nd trial. - Sertraline (Zoloft) and Fluoxetine (Prozac) are most commonly used, least SE (used in TADS, CAMS). - Mild serotonergic side-effects (hyperhidrosis, nausea, headache, tremulousness, diarrhea) can happen w/ SSRI/SNRI initiation and/or uptitration, usually goes away in 2-3 days 23.7 Suicide If you don’t directly ask about suicide, you won’t hear about it. NEVER assume! You don’t have to be depressed to be suicidal. ~4% of patients coming in to ED (for all complaints) are suicidal. Adolescents more likely to kill selves by firearm; children by strangulation ASQ: Adolescent Suicide Screening Tool In the past few weeks, have you wished you were dead? In the past few weeks, have you felt that you or your family would be better off if you were dead? - Yes to 1 or 2 (passive SI): Counsel, supportive listening, referrals In the past week, have you been having thoughts about killing yourself? Have you ever tried to kill yourself? Are you having thoughts of killing yourself right now? - Yes to 3 or 5 (active SI): Immediate consult from ER/floor/outpt mental health clinician 23.8 Antidepressants 23.8.1 Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs) 23.8.1.1 Mechanism of Action 5-HT-specific reuptake inhibitor 23.8.1.2 Use Depression, Gen. anxiety disorder, Panic disorder, OCD, bulimia, social anxiety disorder, PTSD, premature ejaculation, premenstrual dysphoric disorder - It normally takes 4–8 weeks for antidepressants to have full effect. Fluoxetine (Prozac), Paroxetine (Paxil), Sertraline (Zoloft), Citalopram (Celexa), Escitalopram (Fl ashbacks par alyze se nior cit izens) Paroxetine → short half-life → discontinuation syndrome (flu-like sxs, dizzy, diaphoretic, “electric shock,” + depression). Do not use in adolescents due to black box warning for suicide. Fluoxetine → long half-life → no need to taper/good for poor compliance, P450 inhibitor, can ↑antipsychotics → ↑SEs Citalopram/Escitalopram → Dose dependent QTc prolongation (usually minimal) 23.8.1.3 Side Effects GI distress, SIADH, sexual dysfunction (anorgasmia, ↓ libido), insomnia, anorexia, ↑ suicidality in adolescents , QTc prolongation, mildly ↓ Na (i.e. 128) Serotonin syndrome: 2 meds that ↑ serotonin (MAOis, SNRIs, TCAs, Opoids, Tramadol, Linezolid) → ↑↑ serotonin in brain. (ex: triptan/SSRIs) 3 A’s: neuromuscular Activity (clonus, hyperreflexia, hypertonia, tremor, seizure), Autonomic stim (hyperthermia, diaphoresis, diarrhea), and Agitation. Tx: cyproheptadine (5-HT2 receptor antagonist) or benzodiazepines 23.8.2 Serotonin-Norepinephrine Reuptake Inhibitors (SNRIs) 23.8.2.1 Mechanism of Action Inhibit 5-HT and NE reuptake 23.8.2.2 Use Depression, general anxiety disorder, diabetic neuropathy. Venlafaxine → also indicated for social anxiety disorder, panic disorder, PTSD, OCD, menopausal depression (b/c of NE effects) Duloxetine → also used for neuropathy (vs. Amitriptyline is better in suicidal patient who might overdose) 23.8.2.3 Examples Venlafaxine (Effexor), Duloxetine (Cymbalta), desvenlafaxine, levomilnacipran, milnacipran. 23.8.2.4 Side Effects ↑ BP most common; also stimulant effects, sedation, nausea 23.8.3 Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs) 23.8.3.1 Mechanism of Action Block reuptake of NE and 5-HT. (-triptyline, -pramine –doxepin) 23.8.3.2 Use Major depression, OCD (clomipramine), peripheral neuropathy, chronic pain, migraine prophylaxis. 23.8.3.3 Examples 3° amines: -Amitriptyline (pain/migraines), Imipramine (enuresis), clomipramine (OCD), doxepin 2° amines: -Nortriptyline, amoxapine, desipramine (ADHD) 23.8.3.4 Side Effects Tri-C’s: CNS toxicity (Convulsions/Coma), Cardiotoxicity (arrhythmia -Na+ channel inhib, ↑QT int), antiCholinergic (urinary retention); Sedation, α1-blocking effects (postural hypotension), anticholinergic SEs (tachycardia, urinary retention, dry mouth) 3° TCAs (amitriptyline) have more anticholinergic effects than 2° TCAs (nortriptyline). QRS duration &gt;100 msec → assoc. w. ↑risk of arrhythmias and/or seizures =indication for Tx: NaHCO3-stabilizes myocardium, alkalinize urine Confusion/hallucinations in elderly due to anticholinergic side effects (use nortriptyline) 23.8.4 Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs) Note: Rarely used anymore 23.8.4.1 Mechanism of Action Nonselective MAO inhibition → ↑ levels of amine neurotransmitters (NE, 5-HT,dopamine) 23.8.4.2 Use Atypical depression (hypersomnia, ↑ appetite, heavy extremities, ↑ sensitivity to interpersonal rejection) Anxiety - Selegiline → only antidepressant that comes in dermal patch form (good for patient that cannot tolerate PO) 23.8.4.3 Examples Phenelzine, Isocarboxazid, Tranylcypromine, (MAO Takes Pride In Shanghai), Selegiline (selective MAO-B inhibitor – Parkinson’s, Transdermal). 23.8.4.4 Side Effects Hypertensive crisis (tyramine (cheese, wine)) → ↑↑ BP, HA, sweating, N/V, photophobia, autonomic instability, stroke/death Tx: Nitroprusside, Phentolamine Serotonin Syndrome: MAOIs are contraindicated in combo w/ SSRIs, TCAs, Tramadol, Linezolid, St. John’s wort, meperidine, dextromethorphan - Wait 2 weeks after stopping MAO inhibitors before starting serotonergic drugs or stopping dietary restrictions. Linezolid is a weak MAOI, and warrants avoidance of norepi and serotonergic drugs (big problem in CF patients w/ depression), otherwise risk hypertensive urgency and/or serotonin syndrome, respectively 23.8.5 Norepinephrine-Dopamine Reuptake Inhibitors (NDRIs) 23.8.5.1 Mechanism of Action ↑ norepinephrine and Dopamine via unknown mechanism 23.8.5.2 Use MDD w/ sexual side effects from SSRI’s, MDD w/ wt gain/hypersomnia (bupropion is PRO penis, not Bulemic).

Benztropine (NOT L-dopa b/c ↑ dopamine → ↑ psychosis) 2. Trihexyphenidyl, maybe amantadine Tardive dyskinesia Mos-yrs Repetitive orofacial movements - dopamine hypersensitivity 1. STOP antipsychotic (may worsen when first stop) 2. START atypical -&gt; Quetiapine or Clozapine Neuroleptic malignant syndrome: Fever (&gt;103), Rigidity, ↑ CPK → rhabdo, AKI - Due to dopamine dysregulation. Caused by: typical/atypical antipsychotics, antiemetics, antiparkinson med withdrawal, infection, surgery - FEVER: Fever, Encephalopathy (AMS), Vitals unstable, ↑ Enzymes, Rigidity (lead pipe), leukocytosis - Compare to Serotonin Syndrome → NMS (↑↑Rigidity), SS (↑DTRs/clonus, GI sxs) - Tx; (1) STOP drug (most important intervention) (2) Hydrate, cooling blankets If no response to stopping drug →(3) Dantrolene (inhibition of Ca2+ release)/ Bromocriptine/Amantadine (4) ECT 23.9.1.5 Notes IV and IM carry more risk of QTc and torsades than PO Our hospital has policy that only can get IV haloperidol while on telemetry (ICUs and 8E) 23.9.2 Atypical Antipsychotics (2nd Generation) 23.9.2.1 Mechanism of Action Blocking D2 receptor AND serotonin 2A receptor blockade 23.9.2.2 Use Schizophrenia (better neg sx coverage than typicals), bipolar disorder, OCD, anxiety disorder, depression, mania, Tourette syndrome 23.9.2.3 Side Effects ALL SE’s: Metabolic side effects → sleepy and fat, → W/u: EKG, Lipids, BMI - Olanzapine → Obesity (metabolic syndrome) - Risperidone → ↑prolactin (↓dopamine activity in tuberoinfundibular pathway→ gynecomastia, galactorrhea, amenorrhea) - Quetiapine → best for movement disorders (ex: Parkinson’s) - Ziprasidone → starts w/ Z worst for the qTC, ↓metabolic effects - Aripiprazole → light and “ari” → doesn’t put you to sleep/lead to weight gain; partial agonist at D2 - Clozapine → D4 blockade is primary effect, must watch closely → monitor WBC and ANC – 3 good: best efficacy (if nothing else working), ↓ risk of suicide in schizophrenia (lithium only other), good for Lewy Body Dementia – 6 bad (1) Agranulocytosis (CBCd before/wkly for 1st 6 mo→ ANC &lt;1500 → Tx: STOP. (2) Myocarditis (EKG, troponins, etc) (3) ↓ Seizure threshold (most common) (4) Wt gain (worse than olanzapine) (5) Sedation (6) Sialorrhea Others in this class not already mentioned above: Asenapine, Iloperidone, Lurasidone, Paliperidone 23.10 Mood Stabilizers 23.10.1 Lithium 23.10.1.1 Mechanism of Action Not established; possibly related to inhibition of phosphoinositol cascade → inositol = buzzword 23.10.1.2 Use Mood stabilizer for bipolar disorder; blocks relapse and acute manic events. - Drug of choice in acute mania and as prophylaxis for both manic/depressive episodes in bipolar &amp; schizoaffective disorders. - It is also used in cyclothymic disorder and unipolar depression - Excellent at low doses for anti-suicidality Contraindications: chronic kidney disease, heart disease, hyponatremia or diuretic use Therapeutic range: 0.8-1.2 mEq/L 23.10.1.3 Side Effects Lithium SEs: Movement (tremor), Nephrogenic Diabetes Insipidus HypOthyroidism, Pregnancy problems (Ebstein anomaly) (LMNOP). Skin problems (acne, psoriasis). - Prior to starting: ECG, BUN, creatinine, Ca2+, u/s,, thyroid function tests, CBC, and a pregnancy test Almost exclusively excreted by kidneys; most is reabsorbed at PCT w/ Na+ - ↑ Li+ levels: NSAIDs, Aspirin, Thiazides, ACEi/ARBs, Metronidazole, Dehydration, Salt depr, Sweating (salt loss), ↓renal fxn - ↓ Li+ levels: K+ sparing diuretics, Theophylline, CCB/Furosemide may ↑/↓ Acute Lithium toxicity: tremor, diarrhea, vomiting, weakness, polyuria, polydipsia, ataxia, cognitive impairment Chronic Lithium toxicity: nephrogenic diabetes insipidus, thyroid dysfunction, hyperparathyroidism 23.10.2 Valproic Acid (Depakote) 23.10.2.1 Mechanism of Action ↑ Na+ channel inactivation, ↑ GABA concentration by inhibiting GABA transaminase 23.10.2.2 Use Bipolar (acute mania, mixed features, rapid cycling), Migraine prophylaxis, Myoclonic seizures 23.10.2.3 Side Effects Hepatotoxicity (measure LFTs)/↑ ammonia, Hemorrhagic Pancreatitis, ↓ plts, neural tube defects, tremor, wt gain/PCOS, hair loss 23.10.3 Carbamazepine (Tegretol) 23.10.3.1 Mechanism of Action Blocks Na+ channels 23.10.3.2 Use Bipolar (esp. mania w/ mixed features and rapid-cycling), Antiepileptic, Trigeminal neuralgia 23.10.3.3 Side Effects cyt P-450 inducer (↓ Warfarin effects → bleed, ↓ OCP effects → pregnancy), blood dyscrasias (agranulocytosis (↓ ANC), aplastic anemia), liver toxicity, teratogenesis, SIADH, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Diplopia, ataxia 23.10.4 Buspirone (BuSpar) 23.10.4.1 Mechanism of Action Stimulates 5-HT1A receptors 23.10.4.2 Use Generalized anxiety disorder 23.10.4.3 Side Effects Does not cause sedation, addiction, or tolerance. Takes 1–2 wks to take effect. Does not interact w/ alcohol (vs barbiturates, benzodiazepines) 23.10.5 Benzodiazepines 23.10.5.1 Mechanism of Action Facilitate GABA-A action by ↑ freq of Cl− channel opening. ↓ REM sleep. “Frenzodiazepines” ↑ frequency. Benzos, barbs, and alcohol all bind the GABA-A receptor, which is a ligand-gated Cl− channel. Most have long half-lives/active metabolites (except: Alprazolam, Triazolam, Oxazepam, Midazolam→ short acting, ↑ addictive potential) 23.10.5.2 Use Anxiety, akathisia, spasticity, status epilepticus (Lorazepam, diazepam), eclampsia, detoxification (esp. alcohol withdrawal/DTs), night terrors, sleepwalking, general anesthetic (amnesia, muscle relaxation), hypnotic (insomnia) 23.10.5.3 Examples Diazepam (Valium), Clonazepam (Klonopin), Lorazepam (Ativan), temazepam, oxazepam (safer for impaired liver), midazolam (Versed), triazolam, chlordiazepoxide (long-acting, used to treat EtOH withdrawal, but not in liver failure), Alprazolam (Xanex). 23.10.5.4 Side Effects Dependence, Additive CNS depression effects w/ alcohol (drowsiness, impaired intellect, motor coordination, amnesia) - Less risk of respiratory depression and coma than in barbiturates. Overdose tx: Flumazenil (competitive antagonist at GABA benzodiazepine receptor) - Can precipitate seizures by causing acute benzodiazepine withdrawal → withdrawal can be life threatening 23.10.6 Barbiturates 23.10.6.1 Mechanism of Action Facilitate GABA-A action by ↑ duration of Cl− channel opening → ↓ neuron firing (barbiturates → ↑ duration). Contraindicated in porphyria. 23.10.6.2 Use Sedative for anxiety, seizures, insomnia, induction of anesthesia (thiopental). 23.10.6.3 Examples Phenobarbital, pentobarbital, thiopental, secobarbital 23.10.6.4 Side Effects Respiratory/cardiovascular depression (can be fatal); CNS depression (exacerbated by alcohol use); dependence - Drug interactions (induces cytochrome P-450) Overdose Tx: supportive (assist respiration and maintain BP) 23.10.7 Non-Benzodiazepine Hypnotics 23.10.7.1 Mechanism of Action Act via the BZ1 subtype of the GABA receptor. Effects reversed by flumazenil. Sleep cycle less affected as compared w/ benzodiazepine hypnotics 23.10.7.2 Use Insomnia. Should be used short-term (weeks-months), although ↓ risk of dependence compared to benzos as sleep aid. 23.10.7.3 Examples Zolpidem (Ambien), Zaleplon (Sonata), esZopiclone (Lunesta). “All ZZZs put you to sleep.” 23.10.7.4 Side Effects Sleep-walking, ataxia, headaches, confusion. Short duration because of rapid metabolism by liver enzymes. Unlike older sedative-hypnotics, cause only modest day-after psychomotor depression and few amnestic effects. 23.11 Other Psychotropic Medications 23.11.1 Stimulants 23.11.1.1 Mechanism of Action ↑ catecholamines in the synaptic cleft, especially norepinephrine and dopamine 23.11.1.2 Use ADHD, narcolepsy (modafinil), appetite control 23.11.1.3 Examples Methylphenidate (Ritalin, Concerta), Dextroamphetamine (Adderall), methamphetamine, Modafinil (Provigil). Atomoxetine (Strattera) is not technically a stimulant, in its own class. 23.11.1.4 Side Effects Hypertension, weight loss, insomnia, exacerbation of tics, ↓ seizure threshold 23.11.2 Acetylcholinesterase Inhibitors 23.11.2.1 Mechanism of Action Inhibits AChE → ↑ ACh in synaptic cleft 23.11.2.2 Use Mild-moderate dementias (neurocognitive disorders) → ex: Alzheimer’s (Donepezil/Rivastigmine) 23.11.2.3 Examples Donepezil (Aricept), Galantamine (Razadyne), Rivastigmine (Exelon) 23.11.3 NMDA (Glutamate) Receptor Antagonist 23.11.3.1 Mechanism of Action Antagonist at NMDA (glutamate) receptor 23.11.3.2 Use ADHD, narcolepsy (modafinil), appetite control 23.11.3.3 Examples Memantine (Nemenda) 23.12 Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT) 23.12.1 Definition Small electric current to produce generalized seizure for 20-30 seconds under general anesthesia 23.12.2 Indications Used in: Unipolar/bipolar depression, catatonia, bipolar mania. For: Treatment resistance, psychotic features, emergent conditions (pregnancy, refusal to eat/drink, imminent risk for suicide), pharmacotherapy contraindicated due to comorbid illness/poor tolerability, hx of ECT response. 23.12.3 Safety No absolute contraindications Increased risk: severe cardiovascular disease, recent MI, space-occupying brain lesion, recent stroke, unstable aneurysm 23.12.4 Side Effects Most common: amnesia (anterograde or retrograde; anterograde resolves rapidly, retrograde persists) – rare w/ unilateral ECT and many experts think repeated general anesthesia may be major contributor 23.13 Psychotherapy Modality Duration Patient Focus Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) Time limited Anxiety, mood, personality, somatic symptom, eating disorder Maladaptive thoughts, avoidance behavior, ability to participate in homework Combines cognitive/behavioral tech Challenges maladaptive thoughts Targets avoidance w/ behavioral techniques (relaxation, exposure) Dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT) Varies Borderline personality disorder; self-injury Improves emotion regulation, mindful awareness, distress tolerance Manages self-harm Interpersonal psychotherapy Time limited Depressed w/ relationship conflicts Links current relationships conflicts to depressive symptoms Supportive psychotherapy Ongoing Lower functioning; in crisis, psychotic Therapist as guide Reinforces coping skills / builds adaptive defenses Motivational interviewing Varies Substance use disorder Addresses ambivalence and enhances motivation to change Nonjudgmental; acknowledge resistance Biofeedback Varies Prominent physical symptoms; pain disorders Improves awareness and control over physiological reactions Lowers stress levels, integrates mind/body "],

PPSV23 and PCV13 should be given to children on immunosuppressants Most importantly, consider the whole picture when arriving at a diagnosis. Presentation, personal/family history, labs must all be taken into account. Autoantibody testing is helpful, however, it is not always diagnostic. 25.2 Inflammatory markers and autoantibodies Marker Description CRP -Acute phase reactant, produced by liver in response to pathogens/inflammation/tissue damage. -Level rises ~ 4-6 hours after injury/infection, peak at ~24-72 hours, then falls after appropriate treatment -CRP can be normal in SLE, JDM/PM, scleroderma, and Sjorgen’s ESR -Acute phase reactant, non-specific marker of inflammation -Rate at which RBCs settle through plasma to form sediment at the bottom of a tube -Slower rise and slower fall compared to CRP -May be elevated due to anemia or hypergammaglobulinemia -May fall quickly in DIC or other conditions that consume or decrease production of fibrinogen ANA -Autoantibodies directed against antigens predominantly found in the nucleus -Conditions associated w/ (+) ANA: —Autoimmune: SLE, MCTD, Sjogren’s, Juvenile Ssc, JIA, JDM, autoimmune hepatitis, Graves’, Hashimoto’s —ID: EBV, HIV, TB, SBE —Systemic inflam.: lymphoproliferative disorders, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, asbestosis -Medications associated w/ (+) ANA and drug-induced lupus (+anti-histone Ab): —Procainamide (90%), Hydralazine (65%), Anti-TNF agents (especially infliximab), INH, Quinidine, Phenytoin, Sulfasalazine, Minocycline, Lithium, chlorpromazine -Titers do not correlate w/ disease severity -Can be found in 10-15% of healthy children, most of whom do not develop autoimmune disease ANCA -Ab targeting antigens in cytoplasmic granules of neutrophils; highly sensitive for vasculitides that have predominant pulmonary and renal involvement -Not used on its own for screening patients, as they can be found in non-vasculitides -Cytoplasmic (c-ANCA): antibody to proteinase-3 &amp; positive in about 90% of patients w/ Granulomatosis w/ Polyangiitis (formerly Wegener’s granulomatosis) -Perinuclear (p-ANCA): antibody to myeloperoxidase &amp; associated w/ microscopic polyangiitis, Churg-Strauss, Ulcerative colitis -Titers often do not correlate w/ disease severity RF -IgM autoantibody that reacts to Fc portion of IgG antibodies-Present in 2-7% of children w/ JIA -Useful for predicting erosive disease in polyarticular JIA -Higher titers can be seen in Sjogren’s Syndrome, MCTD, GPA-Also seen in infections: Chagas, SBE, Hep C, EBV -Circulating immune complexes may give false positive RF results dsDNA -IgG, directed toward ds-DNA -High specificity for SLE -Rising levels associated with flares SSA/Ro SSB/LA -Sjogren’s syndrome-Cutaneous lupus -Neonatal lupus/congenital heart block-La less common and usually not found w/o Ro CCP (ACPA) -High specificity, low sensitivity for JIA-Adults: 70-80% of RA, predicts erosive disease Sm (Smith) -High specificity, 30% of juvenile SLE, 60% of adult SLE-Remains positive when SLE in remission RNP -&gt;95% MCTD-SLE Scl-70 -Systemic sclerosis-Assoc. w/ pulmonary fibrosis Jo-1 -20% of DM/PM-Associated w/ ILD-Mechanic hands-Most frequent Ab in antisynthetase syndrome 25.3 Childhood Vasculitides *Most Common Age Symptoms/Signs Biopsy/Labs Treatment Large Vessel Takayasu’s arteritis FemalesHigher in Asian pop Adol.
