## HEEADSSS Assessment[^1]
Parents, family members, or other involved adults should **NOT** be present during the HEEADSSS interview. Addressing this and the need for confidentiality at the beginning of the visit is important. Before asking adults to leave the room, always ask whether they have any concerns to express or questions to ask and assure them of further interaction once the confidential interview is over. Sometimes having a confidential moment with the adult can also be very informative to the patient’s care.

Consider starting your HEEADSSS assessment by asking about the patient’s **strengths**. A simple question such as “What are your greatest strengths” can go a long way in rapport building and eliciting motivations to engage in healthy behavior change.

## Adolescent Screening Tools

|             |Screeners|When to use|
|-------------|---------|-----------|
|Depression   |[PHQ-2](https://www.hiv.uw.edu/page/mental-health-screening/phq-2), [PHQ-A](https://www.aacap.org/App_Themes/AACAP/docs/member_resources/toolbox_for_clinical_practice_and_outcomes/symptoms/GLAD-PC_PHQ-9.pdf) = PHQ-9 modified for adolescents, [PSC-17](https://depts.washington.edu/hcsats/FCAP/resources/PSC-17%20English.pdf) (up to age 15)|- Routine Child Health Maintenance visits <br> - Visits for mood follow-up <br> - When you’re concerned about depression and/or suicidality in your patient|

## Contraception[^2]

### Emergency Contraception (EC)

|                              |Notes|Access|
|------------------------------|-----|------|
|Ella (ulipristal acetate)|- **Most effective EC pill** to prevent pregnancy **up to 5 days after** unprotected sex <br> - Do NOT give if starting any form of hormonal contraception (ulipristal binds the progesterone receptors and blocks the hormone’s effects)|- **Rx ONLY** <br> - Safe to call in a prescription w/o pregnancy test or seeing patient|
|Plan B One-Step (levonorgestrel 1.5mg)|- Works to prevent pregnancy for the **first 3 days after** unprotected sex <br> - Works less well in patients who are overweight or obese <br> - Discuss with your preceptor if you should recommend a double dose for your overweight patients|- Sold (at cost \$$, w/o Rx) to anyone of any age at most pharmacies, though access is still difficult for adolescents. **Much cheaper w/ Rx.** <br> - Safe to call in a prescription w/o pregnancy test or seeing patient|
|Copper IUD (Paragard)|- **Most effective form of EC** (>99%), effective **up to 7 days after** unprotected sex <br> - Can provide up to 12 years of highly effective contraception after placement|Must be placed in a clinic setting by a trained provider|

**For more information** on emergency contraception (EC), please see the following resources: [Bedsider](https://www.bedsider.org/methods/emergency_contraception), [reproductiveaccess.org](https://www.reproductiveaccess.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/emergency-contraception.pdf), [Mass.gov EC site](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/emergency-contraception-get-the-facts)

### Shared Decision Making (SDM)
- Collaborative process, allows patients and their providers to make healthcare decisions together, taking into account the best scientific evidence available, as well as the patient’s values and preferences
- Provider role: knowledge of the medical information
- Patient role: expert regarding their own values and preferences

### Applying SDM Principles to Contraceptive Counseling Visits

#### Establish rapport
- “What brings you in today? What’s happening with your birth control?”
- “Why did you decide to choose ____?”
- Ask interactive open-ended questions. The HEEADSSS assessment is a great way to establish rapport for new patients.

#### Assess patient readiness
- “What are important features that your birth control should have?”
- “What did you like/dislike about the birth control methods you used in the past?”
- “Different types of birth control affect your period differently. Some make your period a bit heavier, lighter, sporadic, or may take your period away. Which do you think will be best for you?”

#### Tailor information and discussion to patient preferences/needs
- Your patient says they want a method where they will still have a regular period. Counsel them on the contraceptive ring, patch, pill, and copper IUD and NOT on the shot, implant, or LNG IUDs.
- Your patient says they want a method that is easy to keep private. Counsel them on the contraceptive implant, shot, IUD, and ring and NOT on the pill or patch.
- Your patient has heavy periods and doesn’t want them to be any heavier. Provide information on any method other than the copper IUD.
- Your patient says they absolutely want to have a period every month. Provide more information on the LNG 15 and 19.5mg IUDs, and Copper IUD, and NOT the LNG 52mg IUD (Mirena).
- Use patient’s identified preferences for discussing particular methods. Being knowledgeable of contraceptive mechanisms of action, side effects, and delivery routes is important to provide this tailored information.

#### Discuss contraception side effects
- “Patients who begin the birth control pill may have breast tenderness or a mild headache during the first month. These usually go away.”
- “With the LNG 52mg IUD, you may have spotting for about 4 months after placement, then your period will become lighter. After a year with the IUD, some patients stop getting their period.”
- Many patients feel they do not receive adequate information about side effects, and that providers often overlook possible side effects in counseling discussions. It is important to discuss the specific side effects that patients should expect with the contraception type that is aligned with their preferences.

#### Identify misconceptions about specific contraception methods
- “I’m sorry that your friend had a bad experience with the vaginal contraceptive ring and weight gain. This isn’t typical with most ring users. I support you in using this method because it aligns with your preferences. If you experience weight gain, you can absolutely choose a different option.”
- “I hear your concern that your friend had worsening acne with her IUD. We usually don’t see this in the majority of patients, so it’s not likely that it will happen to you.”
- Respectfully addressing myths or misconceptions about IUD types helps to keep conversations open, while providing patients with accurate information.

#### Ensure access to method discontinuation at any time
- “If you decide you don’t like this birth control, you can switch to something else at any time.”
- “If you decide that you want to stop your birth control, I’m always here to talk about it and to support you.”
- “If for whatever reason you decide that you don’t want the IUD anymore, I will remove it.”
- Patients should be informed at the time of insertion that they can have their IUD removed at any time, and for any reason.
- IUD removal should be provided with the immediacy as “same-day” IUD placement is provided.

## Heavy or Irregular Menstrual Bleeding

### PowerPlans / Order Sets / EBGs
Heavy/Irregular Menstrual Bleeding EBG

### Definition
Abnormalities in the frequency, duration, volume, and/or timing of menstrual bleeding

### Differential Diagnosis
Anovulatory bleeding (most common cause in adolescents), pregnancy (**must rule out** even w/o report of sexual activity), coagulopathy, recent start/stop of contraception

### Clinical Manifestations
- Menses prolonged or cycle shortened w/ frequent menses (normal menses happen every 21-45 days)
- Flow moderate to heavy
- May present w/ anemia leading to orthostasis, fatigue, tachycardia, syncope/ presyncope  or exercise intolerance 
- Other changes may include: weight change, visual changes, headache, heat or cold intolerance, skin changes (hirsutism or acne), palpitations, cyclic abdominal pain

### Evaluation
- Labs: CBC w/ diff, urine hCG, gonorrhea and chlamydia testing, coagulation studies, von Willebrand panel, TSH, LH, FSH, prolactin, free/total testosterone, DHEAS
- Imaging: Pelvic ultrasound if mass palpable, uterine abnormality suspected, or patient is not responding to typical therapies
- Exam: External GU exam to evaluate for active bleeding, masses, signs of trauma, virilization
- Ask about personal and family history of bleeding

### Management
- Consider NSAID trial (ibuprofen or naproxen), OCPs (screen for estrogen contraindications to determine type of OCP) continuously (occasionally BID-QID) until bleeding stops, daily iron supplements for anemia. 
- Send to ED if vital signs unstable or with severe anemia (for further workup for surgical cause of bleed, possible transfusion, and possible tranexamic acid or aminocaproic acid)
- Antiemetic PRN nausea associated w/ hormone therapy


## Amenorrhea[^4]

### Definition
- **Primary:** Absence of menses by age 15 or absence of menses 3 years following thelarche
- **Secondary:** Absence of menses for three cycles or for three-six months w/ prior normal menses

### Pathophysiology
- **Primary w/o secondary sex characteristics (no breast development) but normal genitalia (uterus and vagina):** Turner syndrome, abnormal X chromosome, mosaicism, pure gonadal dysgenesis, 17 a-hydroxylase deficiency,  hypothalamic failure secondary to inadequate gonadotropin- releasing hormone (GnRH) release, constitutional delay of puberty
- **Primary w/ normal breast development but absent uterus:** Androgen insensitivity, congenital absence of uterus (MRKH)
- **Primary w/ no breast development and no uterus:** 17,20 desmolase deficiency, agonadism, 17 -hydroxylase deficiency w/ 46 XY karyotype
- **Primary and secondary w/ normal secondary sex characteristics:** Hypothalamic causes (idiopathic, phenothiazines, heroin, stress, exercise, weight loss, chronic illness, craniopharyngioma, tuberculous granuloma, meningoencephalitis, polycystic ovary syndrome), pituitary causes (Sheehan’s syndrome, aneurysm, empty sella, tumors), ovarian causes (premature ovarian insufficiency), uterine causes (Asherman syndrome), pregnancy

### Clinical Manifestations
- May see absence of secondary sex characteristics in conjunction w/ amenorrhea

### Physical Exam
- Height, weight
- Signs of malnutrition, androgen excess, thyroid dysfunction
- Tanner stage, breast exam and pelvic exam
- Webbed neck, low set ears, broad shield-like chest in Turner’s syndrome

### Evaluation
- Pregnancy test, TSH, FSH, prolactin, ultrasound to evaluate for presence of uterus 
- **Primary w/o secondary sex characteristics or absent uterus:** Karyotype, FSH, Testosterone level. 
- **Primary and secondary w/ normal secondary sex characteristics:** Urine pregnancy; FSH; Testosterone level; prolactin level – if elevated, need MRI of head to evaluate for prolactinoma; Progestin withdrawal test: Positive response indicates the production of estrogen w/o normal cycling such as in PCOS (if evidence of hyperandrogenism or elevated testosterone). Negative test w/ low FSH suggests low estrogen state as is seen in hypothalamic amenorrhea from nutritional deficiency. Negative test w/ high FSH indicates ovarian insufficiency.

### Management
- **PCOS:** hormonal contraception or cyclical provera 10mg/day x 10d to induce bleeding
- **Irreversible hypopituitarism or ovarian insufficiency:** Premarin 0.625-2.5 mg/day or transdermal estrogen and Provera 10mg/day medroxyprogesterone 10-14 days per month.
- **Hypothalamic amenorrhea related to nutritional deficiency:** energy re-balance/weight restoration


## Gender Affirming Care

### Why
One of our roles as providers of gender diverse youth is to combat the adverse experiences and risk factors for developing mental health disorders **by building safe communities for our patients and adopting a gender affirming approach to care.**

### How
- Call patients by the name and pronouns that they tell you best describe them in all clinical settings.
- Build our lexicon to help lead our co-workers by example in using appropriate and non-stigmatizing language to affirm the child's or adolescent's authentic self and gender identity (see gender-bread person below for review of terminology).
- Ask about gender identity at routine healthcare visits.
- Individuals who identify as transgender have **higher rates** of depression, anxiety, eating disorders, self-harm, and suicide compared to their cis-gendered peers. **Screen** for these when the opportunity arises and provide appropriate referrals/supports PRN.

## Eating Disorders (ED)

### Anorexia Nervosa (AN) {#anorexia_nervosa}

#### PowerPlans / Order Sets / EBGs
- Restrictive Eating Power Plan and Admission Orderset
- Restrictive Eating EBG

#### Definition
- Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements, leading to a significantly low body weight in the context of age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health
- Significantly low weight is defined as a weight that is less than minimally normal or, for children and adolescents, less than minimally expected
- Intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes w/ weight gain, even though at a significantly low weight
- Disturbance in the way in which one's body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of the current low body weight

#### Clinical Manifestations
Weight loss, abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, cold intolerance, lanugo, fatigue, weakness, delayed puberty

#### Physical Exam
Low body temp, bradycardia, low blood pressure, orthostasis, lanugo, dry skin and hair, scalp hair thinning, scaphoid abdomen, palpable stool, breast atrophy, hypoestrogenized vaginal mucosa

#### Evaluation
- **Labs:** CBCd, UA, urine pregnancy, chem 10, LFTs, TFTs, and EKG
- **Weight:** Compared to prior growth charts; calculate IBW based off of 50% BMI for age (unless previously tracking on different percentile)

#### Inpatient Management
- Restrictive Eating protocol
	- If 18yo+, then must sign contract in ED agreeing to protocol
- Goal is to medically stabilize (weight >80% of IBW), VSS (HR >50, no longer orthostatic), electrolytes stable (monitor potassium, phos and mag)
- Refeed gradually to target meal plan while monitoring for refeeding syndrome (watch for edema, low phos)
- Weight increase of 0.2kg/day, supplement if not gaining weight; 1750-2000kcal diet to be increased by 250 kcal per day until goal calories met, meals per EBG (set time for meal, replace w/ 120% ensure if <75% complete (either PO or via NG))
- Check electrolytes daily and supplement w/ PhosNaK and/or MVI if abnormal (at BCH the protocol is to start both supplements on admission)
- Activity: Bed rest while orthostatic. No physical activity while inpatient; can earn wheelchair rides, bathroom  privileges, etc.
- Consults: Psychiatry, Nutrition
- Supervision: Sitter if active SI, Security if elopement risk

### Bulimia Nervosa (BN)

#### Definition
- Recurrent episodes of binge eating. An episode of binge eating is characterized by both of the following:
	- Eating, in a discrete period of time (eg, w/i any two-hour period), an amount of food that is definitely larger than most people would eat during a similar period of time and under similar circumstances
	- A sense of lack of control over eating during the episode (eg, a feeling that one cannot stop eating or control what or how much one is eating)
- Recurrent inappropriate compensatory behavior to prevent weight gain, such as self-induced vomiting; misuse of laxatives, diuretics, enemas, or other medications; fasting; or excessive exercise
- The binge eating and inappropriate compensatory behaviors both occur, on average, at least once a week for three months
- Self-evaluation is unduly influenced by body shape and weight
- The disturbance does not occur exclusively during episodes of anorexia nervosa

#### Clinical Manifestations
[See AN](#anorexia_nervosa), PLUS: Esophagitis and cavities

#### Physical Exam
[See AN](#anorexia_nervosa), PLUS: Calluses on fingers, cavities, and tooth decay

#### Evaluation
[See AN](#anorexia_nervosa)

#### Inpatient Management
[See AN](#anorexia_nervosa), PLUS: Purge precautions (no bathroom privileges (use bedside commode), room searches)

### Acute Refusal of Food Intake Disorder (ARFID)

#### PowerPlans / Order Sets / EBGs
ARFID protocol and PowerPlan

#### Definition
- Persistent failure to meet appropriate nutritional and/or energy needs associated w/ one (or more) of the following:
	- Significant weight loss  
	- Significant nutritional deficiency
	- Dependence on eneteral feeding or oral nutritional supplements
	- Marked interference w/ psychosocial functioning
- Disturbance not better explained by lack of available food
- **No evidence of a disturbance in body image**

#### Pathophysiology
- Patients w/ autism, ADHD, and intellectual disabilities are more likely to develop ARFID
- Often have co-occurring anxiety disorder; high risk for other psychiatric disorders

#### Clinical Manifestations
[See AN](#anorexia_nervosa), PLUS: Fear of choking or vomiting, limited range of preferred foods becomes narrower over time, will only eat certain textures of food, etc.

#### Evaluation
[See AN](#anorexia_nervosa)

#### Inpatient Management
- ARFID protocol
- Often requires enteral nutrition (many patients will go home on enteral feeds)
