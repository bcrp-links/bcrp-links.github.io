## Key Questions for Taking a Dermatologic HIstory
- When did it start? (ask for timepoints, i.e., “before Christmas?”)
- Does it itch, burn, or hurt?
- When was the first episode?
- Where on the body did it start? Was it present at birth?
- How has it spread (pattern of spread)?
- How have individual lesions changed? (Size, shape, color, itch, bleeding?)
- Is there a family history? (eczema, acne, psoriasis, autoimmune disease)
- What has made it worse or triggered it?
- What have you tried for it? Did it help?
- Hx of atopic triad (asthma, allergies, atopic dermatitis)?
- New exposures: Medications? (Look at external med rec) Travel? Environmental?
- Ask if they brought the medications they are using


## Describing Dermatologic Lesions

### Primary Lesion

|   |Description of the "family" of a lesion|Appearance|
|---|---------------------------------------|----------|
|Macule|Flat, not palpable; color change; <1cm (e.g., freckle, labial macule)|![](./images/derm_lesions-macule.png)|
|Patch|Flat, not palpable; color change; >1cm (e.g., congenital nevus or large birthmark)|![](./images/derm_lesions-patch.png)|
|Papule|Raised; <1 cm (e.g. mole, acne)|![](./images/derm_lesions-papule.png)|
|Plaque|Raised; >1 cm usual flat topped (e.g. psoriasis)|![](./images/derm_lesions-plaque.png)|
|Nodule|Raised; round-topped lesion w/ depth; >0.5cm up to 1 cm (e.g. acne)|![](./images/derm_lesions-nodule.png)|
|Tumor|Very large, round-topped lesion w/ depth, exophytic, endophytic or level w/ skin surface ; >1cm (e.g. strawberry hemangioma of infancy)|![](./images/derm_lesions-tumor.png)|
|Wheal|Edematous, raised, hive-like|![](./images/derm_lesions-wheal.png)|
|Vesicle|Small fluid-containing blister <1cm  (e.g. chickenpox, shingles zoster)|   |
|Bulla|Large fluid-containing blister > 1cm (e.g. bullous pemphigoid)|   |
|Pustule|Exudate filled; <1cm; can develop into furuncle, then abscess (e.g. pustular psoriasis)|   |
|Telangiectasia|Dilated superficial capillaries|   |
|Verrucae|Soft, tan-colored, cauliflower-like papules (e.g. warts caused by HPV)|   |

### Secondary Changes
Describe the changes that occur superimposed upon the primary lesion

- **Scale:** Flakes of “dead skin”; thickening of outermost layer (stratum corneum)
- **Crust:** Adherent, dried serum, exudate or blood on the skin
- **Desquamation:** Thicker scale that is shedding off
- **Erosion:** Loss of superficial layers of skin (epidermis only involved, does not scar); erosions lead to ulcerations
- **Ulceration:** Loss of deeper layers of skin (extends to dermis, scars)
- **Fissure:** Deep linear cracks in skin
- **Atrophy:** Thinning of skin; can be in the epidermis, dermis, or subcutaneous fat
- **Excoriation:** Erosions due to scratching
- **Lichenification:** Thickened, leather-like skin, normal skin lines accentuated
- **Scar/keloid:** Permanent fibrotic changes that result from damage extending into the dermis, keloids extend beyond the borders of the original defect
- **Umbilicated:** Centrally indented

### Color Descriptor
- **Erythematous:** Blanchable red or pink hue in the skin, indicates vascular dilation; erythema is not a color per se
- **Purpuric:** Violaceous color due to blood pigment
- **Petechial:** Pinpoint, non-blanching bleeding into the skin from capillaries
	- **Purpura** = 1cm, **ecchymoses** > 1cm
- **Hyperpigmentation:** Darker than normal skin color
- **Hypopigmentation:** Lighter than normal skin color

### Lesion Shapes
- **Annular:** Ring-shaped lesion ![](./images/derm_lesions-annular.png)
- **Nummular/discoid/round:** Coin-shaped lesion ![](./images/derm_lesions-nummular.png)
- **Arcuate:** Arc-shaped lesion ![](./images/derm_lesions-arcuate.png)
- **Linear** Forming a line ![](./images/derm_lesions-linear.png)
- **Serpiginous:** Wavy like a snake ![](./images/derm_lesions-serpiginous.png)
- **Figurate/polycyclic:** Lots of different ring shapes, rings within rings ![](./images/derm_lesions-figurate.png)
- **Retiform/reticulate:** Web or net-like, following vasculature ![](./images/derm_lesions-figurate.png)
- **Targetoid:** Lesions with a bull’s eye, or concentric rings or varying colors ![](./images/derm_lesions-targetoid.png)

### Distribution
- **Clustered (agminated):** Grouped together in a bunch but not running together
- **Discrete/scattered:** Lesions are separate from one another
- **Acral:** Over distal portions of limbs: finger tips, knuckles, elbows, knees, buttocks, toes, heels
- **Generalized:** Throughout body
- **Photodistributed:** Sun-exposed areas
- **Coalescing:**

## Principles of Dermatologic Therapy
The efficacy of any topical medication is related to:

- Active ingredient (inherent strength)
- Concentration of medication
- Anatomic location
- Vehicle (mode in which it is transported)
	- **Ointment:** (e.g. Vaseline). Lubricating, semi-occlusive, greasy, does not sting. Useful for smooth, non-hairy skin, dry, thick or hyperkeratotic lesions.
	- **Cream:** Less greasy, not occlusive, may sting, could cause irritation, vanish when rubbed in. Useful for acute exudative inflammation, intertriginous areas.
	- **Lotion:** Less greasy, less occlusive, may sting, pourable liquid. Useful for acute exudative inflammation (e.g. acute contact dermatitis) and on hairy areas.
	- **Oil:** Less stinging, keratolytic (removes scale). Useful for the scalp, especially for people with coarse or very curly hair.
	- **Gel:** May sting, greaseless, least occlusive, dries quickly. Useful for acne and on scalp/hairy areas without matting.
	- **Foam:** Spreads readily, easier to apply, more expensive, cosmetically elegant. Useful for hairy areas and inflamed skin.
	- **Spray:** Aerosols (rarely used), pump sprays

![](./images/derm_vehicles.png)

### Quantities of Topicals to Prescribe
- When deciding how much topical to prescribe, think in terms of lesion size and body surface area (BSA)
	- 1 Finger Tip Unit (FTU) = 0.5 grams topical medication dispensed from a 5mm nozzle placed on pad of index finger from distal tip to DIP joint = 2 adult palms =  2% BSA
		![](./images/derm_topicals-ftu.png)
		- *Example:* How much topical medication should you Rx for 2% BSA BID x30 days?
			- 1 FTU = 0.5 grams = 2% BSA
			- 0.5 grams x 2 times per day = 1 gram
			- 1 gram x 30 days = 30 grams
	- Remember that children, especially infants, have a high BSA to volume ratio, which puts them at risk for systemic absorption of topically applied medications


## Topical Steroids

### Classes of Topical Steroids

|Potency Class|Common Examples|
|-------------|---------------|
|**Class 1:** Superpotent|Betamethasone 0.05% G/O/L, Clobetasol 0.05% C/O/G/S/F, Diflorasone 0.05% O, Halobetasol 0.05%|
|**Class 2:** Potent|Betamethasone 0.05% C, Desoximetasone 0.25% C/ 0.05% G, Fluocinonide 0.05% C/O/G/S|
|**Class 3:** Upper Mid|Betamethasone valerate 0.1%/0.12%F, Diflorasone 0.05% C, Triamcinolone 0.1% O|
|**Class 4:** Mid-Strength|Fluocinolone 0.025% O, Hydrocortisone 0.2% O, Mometasone 0.1% C/L, Triamcinolone 0.1% C|
|**Class 5:** Lower Mid|Desonide 0.05% O, Fluocinolone 0.025%, Hydrocortisone 0.2% C, Triamcinolone 0.025% O/L|
|**Class 6:** Mid|Betamethasone 0.1% C, Desonide 0.05% C, Fluocinolone 0.01% C/S, Triamcinolone 0.025% C|
|**Class 7:** Least Potent|Hydrocortisone 1%-2.5%|
C = cream, G = gel, L = lotion, O = ointment, S = solution, F = foam

- **Potency:** Ointment (thickest, most potent) > Gel > Cream > Lotion (liquidy, easier to spread)
	- Look at the CLASS, not the percentage (e.g. clobetasol 0.05% is much stronger than HC 1%)
- **Uses:**
	- **Class 1** uses: Severe dermatoses over non-facial/non-intertriginous areas, especially good for palms and soles
	- **Class 2-4** uses: Mild-to-moderate non-facial/non-intertriginous dermatoses, okay to use on flexural surfaces for limited periods
	- **Class 5-7** uses: Consider when treating large areas (given likelihood of systemic absorption), also for eyelid/genital dermatoses

### Side Effects of Topical Steroids
- **Local side effects** of topical steroids: Skin atrophy, telangiectasias, striae, acne or rosacea-like eruptions, allergic contact dermatitis, hypopigmentation
- **Systemic side effects** of topical steroids (rare d/t low percutaneous absorption): Glaucoma, HPA suppression, Cushing’s syndrome, hypertension, hyperglycemia
	- Exercise caution w/ widespread use and occlusive methods (e.g. plastic wrap, bandages)
- For all steroids, **do not use for more than 14 days per month.** Instruct patients to use in pulse (a few days at a time) manner. 


## Sun Protection

### Types of Sunscreen

|Physical Blockers|Chemical Sunscreens|
|-----------------|-------------------|
|- Blocks and scatters UV and visible light<br>- Active ingredients include zinc oxide, titanium dioxide, iron oxide<br>- Less irritating to sensitive skin and immediately effective|- Absorbs light and re-emits energy as insignificant quantities of heat<br>- Active ingredients are benzophenone, avobenzone, oxybenzone<br>- Not as messy, easier to apply, less apparent white sheen|

### Choosing Sunscreen
- Sunscreens are best for protection against UVB and UVA rays
- “Broad spectrum” sunscreens are the best
- SPF 30 blocks 97% of sun’s rays
- “Water resistant” sunscreens need to be re-applied q2h
- Sun’s rays are strongest between 10AM - 4PM
- Good rule of thumb: “If your shadow appears to be shorter than you are, seek shade”
- Avoid sunscreen use in infants less than 6 months of age. Instead use protective clothing, such as long sleeve clothing and  a hat w/ brim.
