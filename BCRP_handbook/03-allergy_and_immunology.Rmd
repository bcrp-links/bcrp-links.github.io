## Primary Immunodeficiencies

### Pathophysiology

- Genetic defects in the adaptive (B- or T-cell) or innate (phagocytes, complement) immune systems lead to recurrent infections
- Over 200 distinct disorders: B cell defects (65%), combined B and T cell deficiencies (15%), phagocytic disorders (10%), T cell deficiencies (5%), and complement deficiencies/others (5%)

### Epidemiology

The overall incidence is 1:10000, and overall prevalence is 1:2000.

**Clinical** Can be nonspecific and broad

**Constitutional**: Poor growth, failure to thrive

**GI**: chronic diarrhea.

**Derm**: Atopic and non-atopic dermatitis, severe diaper rash, neonatal rash, anhydrosis, as well as delayed separation of the umbilical cord (LAD)

**Immuno**: Recurrent infections, autoimmunity Family history of consanguinity or family history of immunodeficiency or unexplained childhood deaths puts a child at higher risk of having or developing a primary immunodeficiency

### **Physical Exam**

**Vital signs**: Growth parameters

**General exam**: Note dysmorphisms, including teeth and hair (abnormal in NEMO). Look for infectious sources (sinusitis, otitis, pneumonia, thrush, diaper rash)

**HEENT exam**: Note tonsils (absent in XLA) and examine for thrush and other signs of infection such as sinusitis or recurrent otitis media

**CV exam**: Note any cardiac anomalies including heart sounds, pulses, perfusion, and overall volume status as cardiac anomalies can be a part of certain syndromes associated w/ immunodeficiency syndromes (e.g.: DiGeorge Syndrome)

**Respiratory**: Note symmetry of lung exam, quality of air entry, and lung sounds as pulmonary anomalies may be a manifestation of immunodeficiency syndromes

**GI**: A thorough GI exam including abdominal exam for elements like hepatosplenomegaly and rectal exam for possible anal atresia is important

**GU**: Primary immunodeficiencies can also lead to GU anomalies; assess for absence/presence of appropriate male/female organs in the correct number

**Derm exam**: Skin exam for eczema/dermatitis (i.e. WAS, SCID, hyper IgE syndrome) as well as erythroderma (Omenn Syndrome). Note telangiectasia (AT), warts, granulomas, poor wound healing or ulcers

**Neuro**: A thorough neuro exam may also hint at the etiology of an immunodeficiency (ataxia-telangiectasia), an infection such as meningitis, or may help elucidate an alternate cause of symptoms

### Diagnosis

**Initial labs**: CBC w/ differential (note especially lymphopenia), chem7, albumin, urinalysis, ESR, CRP, quantitative immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE), specific vaccine antibody studies (tetanus, HiB, pneumococcal).

**Follow-up labs**: HIV testing. B- and T-cell subset, complement screening (C3, C4, AH50, CH50), vaccine challenge (administer pneumococcal or other vaccine and measure titers 4-6 weeks later), Dihydrorhodamine (DHR) assay (CGD). Leukocyte adhesion defect testing (LAD).

**Advanced lab analysis**: T cell proliferation studies (mitogen, antigen), T and B cell memory panels, NK cell function assays, Toll-like receptor assays. Immunodeficiency genetic panel. Whole exome or whole genome sequencing.

### Treatment

Varies widely based upon the deficiency. Common therapies include prophylactic antibiotics, IVIG, bone marrow transplant.

## General Approach to the Immunodeficient Patient

Approaching the immunodeficient patient in clinic:

- See indications for testing/tests above.
- Is antibiotic prophylaxis indicated?
- Can they receive immunizations? If they can, have they mounted a sufficient immune response to vaccines (ie. do they need vaccine titers)?
- Low threshold for antibiotic use in the event that infection is suspected.

Managing a sick immunodeficient patient:

- Obtain blood culture and labs.
- Give antibiotics/antivirals promptly.
- Determine whether imaging/surgery is indicated (ie. drain an abscess).
- Be aware of blood products given. Blood may need to be from CMV negative donors, filtered to remove WBCs, and irradiated.
- Replace missing immune components (ie. IVIG)
