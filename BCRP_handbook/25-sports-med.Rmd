## General Approach to the MSK Exam

1. **History**
	- Mechanism, chronicity, exposures, associated symptoms
	- **Red flags:** B symptoms, major trauma
2. **Inspection:** Compare to contralateral side. Make sure to EXPOSE for best exam.
	- Look for asymmetry, atrophy, deformity, ecchymosis, erythema, scars
	- **Red flags:** Erythema (sign of infxn), deformity concerning for major trauma
3. **Palpation**
	- Feel for anatomic points of interest
	- **Red flags:** Warmth (sign of infxn), diminished sensation (sign of neurologic deficit)
4. **Range of motion (ROM):** Active first, then passive
	- Look for pain w/ motion, limited ROM (and distinguish whether due to pain, effusion, mechanical problem)
5. **Strength**
	- Graded from 0-5 out of 5:
		- 5/5 = full strength
		- 4/5 = movement against some resistance
		- 3/5 = movement against gravity
		- 2/5 = movement but not against gravity
		- 1/5 = muscle flicker
		- 0/5 = no contraction
	- **Red flags:** Diminished strength if not due to pain (sign of neurologic deficit)
6. **Special testing** is joint specific - see relevant sections below

## Pre-Participation Physical

#### History
- **Goal:** Elucidate conditions that might preclude or limit sports participation
- Cardiac history 
- Dyspnea on exertion ‚Üí consider exercise induced asthma or vocal cord dysfunction
- History of head trauma
- History of ‚Äúburners‚Äù or ‚Äústingers‚Äù (from transient brachial plexus compression/stretching) ‚Üí if recurrent, may need C-spine XR
- Disordered eating (esp/ in sports w/ weight requirements)
- Substance abuse
- **Family history:** Sudden death, congenital heart disease, arrhythmias, Marfan syndrome

#### Physical Exam
Special attention to **CV**, **resp**, and **MSK** (assess ROM, symmetry, stability)

#### Cardiac Testing
- e.g. EKG, echo, exercise testing
- ONLY if clinically indicated, though highly controversial and recommendations worldwide differ. Current AHA/AAP PPE guidelines currently **do not recommend** global EKG/echo.

#### Clearance
- Increased risk of injury?
- Would treatment make athlete safe to participate?
- Can limited participation be allowed while treatment is undergone?
- Limitations for some or all sports?


## Upper Extremity: Elbow, Forearm & Wrist

### Anatomy
![](./images/sports_anatomy-elbow-forearm-wrist.png)

### Exam Pearls

- Rapid elbow/forearm neurovascular exam:
	- **Brachial artery:** Brachial + radial pulses, perfusion check
	- **Median nerve:** Sensation over palmar side of digits 1-3
	- **Anterior interosseous nerve** (motor-only branch of median nerve): ‚ÄúOK‚Äù sign üëå, grip strength
	- **Radial nerve:** Wrist extension, thumbs-up sign üëç
	- **Ulnar nerve:** Spread fingers against resistance

### Supracondylar Fracture

#### Description/Mechanism
Usually fall on outstretched hand (FOOSH) with elbow hyperextension

![](./images/sports_nursemaids-elbow.png)

#### Diagnosis
- **Exam:** Gross deformity, limited active elbow motion
- **Imaging:** AP + lateral XR. Findings may be subtle (posterior fat pad sign on lateral film)

#### Management
- Ortho consult
- Usually surgical fixation for displaced fractures

### Nursemaid's Elbow (Subluxation of Radial Head)

#### Description/Mechanism
Traction on arm with extended elbow (e.g. swinging child through the air)

#### Diagnosis
- **Exam:** No deformity, elbow held in passive pronation with slight flexion, refusing to use arm
- **Imaging:** Unnecessary unless suspect fracture based on H&P, or if reduction unsuccessful

#### Management
Stabilize elbow w/ one hand ‚Üí supinate forearm and flex elbow (will usually feel/hear click)

### Distal Radius Fracture

#### Description/Mechanism
- FOOSH
- **Most common pediatric fracture**

#### Diagnosis
- **Exam:** Pain, ecchymosis, swelling
- **Imaging:** AP + lateral XR of wrist and forearm; consider AP + lateral of elbow if tender or if diaphyseal fractures present

#### Management
- Ortho consult
- Depending on severity, may require anything from immobilization to ORIF

- Direct blow to lateral shoulder

#### Signs & Symptoms
History of trauma, severe shoulder pain, pain w/ arm movement

#### Diagnosis
- **Exam:** tenderness, swelling, shoulder asymmetry, arm shortened and held in extension
- **Imaging:** AP + axillary XR of humerus
	- Also get scapular ‚ÄúY‚Äù view if concerned for shoulder injury
	- Suspect Salter-Harris I if negative XR + tenderness at physis

#### Management
- Immobilization
- Likely Ortho consult, esp. if more severe (a/w shoulder dislocation, neurovascular compromise, etc.)

### Dislocation

#### Description/Mechanism
- Majority of dislocations are **anterior**
- Blow to abducted/externally rotated/extended arm
- FOOSH
- Forceful forward swinging of arm

#### Diagnosis
- **Exam:** Arm abducted and externally rotated w/ resistance to all movement, loss of rounded appearance of shoulder. Evaluate for sensory loss over lateral deltoid (2/2 axillary nerve dysfunction).
- **Imaging:** AP + scapular ‚ÄúY‚Äù + axillary XR to confirm dx and exclude fractures (can be repeated post-reduction if unsure of success)

#### Management
Reduction (variety of techniques exist) ‚Üí immobilization and referral to Sports Med/Ortho for prevention of recurrent dislocation

### Rotator Cuff Injury

#### Description/Mechanism
- Includes **impingement** (inflammation & pinching of rotator cuff tendons) and rotator cuff **tears** 
	- Impingement very common, tears very uncommon in youth athletes
- Overuse or acute injury, usually involving throwing or overhead activities

#### Signs & Symptoms
Pain in upper arm, worse w/ overhead activity or lying on affected side

#### Diagnosis
- **Exam:** Pain/weakness w/ testing of rotator cuff muscles; positive empty can, lift off, Hawkins, and/or impingement tests (see above)
- **Imaging:** XR only if bony pathology suspected; MRI best

#### Management

- **Imaging:** XR (abnormal in more severe injury, may be normal if joint space not widened)

#### Management
- Less severe injury (no separation of joint capsule) ‚Üí sling 1-2 wks, ice, NSAIDs ‚Üí early motion as able, including flexion/extension at elbow
- More severe injury ‚Üí likely surgical intervention

### Clavicular Fracture

#### Description/Mechanism
Classified by location: most common is **midshaft fracture** > distal third > proximal third

#### Diagnosis
- Exam: Arm held adducted close to body, often supported w/ opposite hand; point tenderness, crepitus
	- **Neurovascular** and **respiratory** exam **crucial** due to risk of brachial plexus and lung injury
- Imaging: XR

#### Management
- Most heal well w/ sling, but indications for surgery are controversial
- Any sign of neurovascular compromise ‚Üí acute reduction needed


## Lower Extremity: Hip

### Anatomy
![](./images/sports_anatomy-hip.png)

### Exam Pearls & Special Tests
- Hip pain can refer to groin, thigh, or knee, or can present as limp/refusal to walk w/o complaint of pain 
	- Pain from intra-articular pathology often localizes to groin
- **Barlow/Ortolani:** Remember to apply gentle anterior pressure to the trochanter during abduction (Ortolani test)
- **Trendelenburg test:** Positive when patient stands on one leg and the contralateral hip drops, indicative of gluteals/hip abductor weakness
- **FABER** (Flexion, Abduction, External Rotation): Test for hip or SI joint pathology
- **FADIR** (Flexion, Adduction, Internal Rotation): Test for hip impingement
- **Log roll test:** Patient on back w/ leg fully extended and relaxed, examiner passively rotates leg and hip internally and externally. Pain should yield high suspicion for intra-articular pathology.

![](./images/sports_special-tests-trendelenburg.png)

![](./images/sports_scfe.png)

### Developmental Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH)

#### Description/Mechanism
- Abnormal development of shallow acetabulum causing hip joint instability

- Common in athletes
- Difficult to differentiate from hip flexor tendinitis

![](./images/sports_fai.png)

#### Diagnosis

#### Management
- Referral to Ortho/Sports Med
- May be treated conservatively (non-weight-bearing or activity limitation) vs. operatively (if lesions are unstable or unresponsive to conservative treatment)
