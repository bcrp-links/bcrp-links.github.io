# Rheumatology 

## Pediatric approach to rheumatic disease
* Rheumatology is a field of many unknowns, however, it occurs when chronic inflammation affects the MSK system, blood vessels, and other tissues, presenting with periods of exacerbation and remission
* History is essential: constitutional sx, joint/muscle sx (limp, stiffness, regressing milestones, problems walking/with stairs/dressing), pain, rashes, ulcers, chest pain 
* Physical exam: focus on eyes, skin, muscle, joints 
	* For arthritides see below
* Vaccinations: A few guidelines, but contact Rheumatology for guidance 
	* Varicella, live virus/bacteria vaccines: contraindicated in children taking high dose steroids and biologics 
	* IVIG: children should wait anywhere from 8-11 months after the last dose for immunizations. 
PPSV23 and PCV13 should be given to children on immunosuppressants 
	* Most importantly, consider the whole picture when arriving at a diagnosis. Presentation, personal/family history, labs must all be taken into account. Autoantibody testing is helpful, however, it is not always diagnostic. 

## Inflammatory markers and autoantibodies
| Marker   | Description| 
|---|---|
| **CRP** |-Acute phase reactant, produced by liver in response to pathogens/inflammation/tissue damage. <br> -Level rises ~ 4-6 hours after injury/infection, peak at ~24-72 hours, then falls after appropriate treatment <br> -CRP can be normal in SLE, JDM/PM, scleroderma, and Sjorgen’s|
|**ESR**| -Acute phase reactant, non-specific marker of inflammation <br> -Rate at which RBCs settle through plasma to form sediment at the bottom of a tube <br>-Slower rise and slower fall compared to CRP <br> -May be elevated due to anemia or hypergammaglobulinemia <br> -May fall quickly in DIC or other conditions that consume or decrease production of fibrinogen|
|**ANA**| -Autoantibodies directed against antigens predominantly found in the nucleus <br> -Conditions associated w/ (+) ANA: <br>---_Autoimmune_: SLE, MCTD, Sjogren’s, Juvenile Ssc, JIA, JDM, autoimmune hepatitis, Graves’, Hashimoto’s <br> ---_ID_: EBV, HIV, TB, SBE <br> ---_Systemic inflam._: lymphoproliferative disorders, interstitial pulmonary fibrosis, asbestosis <br>-Medications associated w/ (+) ANA and drug-induced lupus (+anti-histone Ab): <br> ---Procainamide (90%), Hydralazine (65%), Anti-TNF agents (especially infliximab), INH, Quinidine, Phenytoin, Sulfasalazine, Minocycline, Lithium, chlorpromazine <br> -Titers do not correlate w/ disease severity <br> -Can be found in 10-15% of healthy children, most of whom do not develop autoimmune disease 
|**ANCA**| -Ab targeting antigens in cytoplasmic granules of neutrophils; highly sensitive for vasculitides that have predominant pulmonary and renal involvement <br>-Not used on its own for screening patients, as they can be found in non-vasculitides <br> -**Cytoplasmic (c-ANCA)**: antibody to proteinase-3 & positive in about 90% of patients w/ Granulomatosis w/ Polyangiitis (formerly Wegener's granulomatosis) <br> -**Perinuclear (p-ANCA)**: antibody to myeloperoxidase & associated w/ microscopic polyangiitis, Churg-Strauss, Ulcerative colitis <br>-Titers often do not correlate w/ disease severity
|**RF**| -IgM autoantibody that reacts to Fc portion of IgG antibodies<br>-Present in 2-7% of children w/ JIA <br>-Useful for predicting erosive disease in polyarticular JIA <br>-Higher titers can be seen in Sjogren's Syndrome, MCTD, GPA<br>-Also seen in infections: Chagas, SBE, Hep C, EBV <br>-Circulating immune complexes may give false positive RF results

## Henoch-Schonlein Purpura (IgA vasculitis)

**Etiology**:

* No clear etiology
* Frequently preceded by upper respiratory infections (esp streptococcus, staphylococcus, and parainfluenza) or immunizations

**Pathophysiology**:

* Deposition of IgA-containing immune complexes in vessel walls of affected organs and in kidney mesangium activates alternative complement pathway (w/ deposition of C3)
* HSP nephritis and IgA nephropathy are histologically identical


**Clinical Manifestations**:

* Palpable purpura: symmetric, lower limb predominance
	* Present in all cases, but may not be presenting symptom
* Arthralgias/arthritis: oligoarticular, large lower extremity joints (knees, hips, ankles)
	* Occurs in ¾ of cases
* Abdominal pain: diffuse pain, colicky, worse after meals, often w/ nausea or vomiting
	* Occurs in 2/3 of cases
	* 3-4% of HSP patients develop intussusception
* Renal disease: hematuria is most common, but proteinuria/hypertension may be seen
	* Occurs is 20-50% of cases
	* Usually delayed 1-2 weeks after onset
	* <15% children have long-term kidney damage, <1% develop renal failure

**Diagnosis**:

* Palpable purpura (w/o thrombocytopenia or coagulopathy), and ≥1 of the following:
	* Abdominal pain
	* Arthritis/arthralgias
	* Biopsy w/ leukocytoclastic vasculitis (skin) or glomerulonephritis w/ IgA deposition (renal)
* Urinalysis (screen for renal involvement), CBC (Plt normal to elevated), IgA level (NOT helpful)
* Abdominal ultrasound if c/f intussusception


**Treatment**:

* Self-limited, supportive care
* Mild/moderate pain: naproxen
* F/u with PCP for weekly/biweekly urinalysis and BP checks for 1-2months
* Severe pain: steroids reduce sx but do not change clinical course, requires taper (4-8wks)
* Severe renal involvement: proteinuria/hematuria, requires closer follow-up and steroids

## Kawasaki Disease

**Epidemiology**:

* Acute, self-limited systemic vasculitis of medium-sized arteries in infants/children
* Average age of onset ~ 2 years w/ 80% occurring in those < 4 years old
* Incidence in US: 17-18/100,000, M:F = 1.6:1 
* Incidence doubled for Asian Americans, highest incidence in Japan
* Increased rates in winter & spring

**Pathophysiology**:

* May be related to infectious triggers
* Vasculitis begins as a neutrophilic infiltrate; plasma cells producing IgA in vessel walls

**Clinical Manifestations**:

* Classical criteria = fever ≥ 5 days w/ ≥ 4/5 classical criteria, w/o alternative diagnosis
	* *Conjunctivitis*: Bilateral bulbar conjunctival injection (non-exudative & limb sparing)

* Corticosteroids: trials indicate that steroids may be effective as primary/rescue therapy.
* Repeat echo post-treatment, either before or after discharge, to observe improvement
* Patients w/ severe CA dilation may need long-term anticoagulation therapy
* Under study: infliximab, cyclosporine, other immunomodulatory agents

## Pediatric arthritides: Approach to Joint Disease

**Questions to consider**:

* Which joint(s) is/are affected?
* For how long? Persistent vs. intermittent?
* Is there morning stiffness? 
* Has the distribution changed over time?
* Does anything make joint pain better or worse (e.g. movement or prolonged inactivity)?
* What are associated symptoms (fever, rash, weight loss, etc.)?
* Family history of arthritis or autoimmune disease?
* Any exposures (camping, sexual activity, viral illness, etc.)?

**Differential for joint pain**

* ***Trauma/Overuse***: LCP, SCFE, patellar tendonitis, patellofemoral syndrome (sports med!)
* ***Infection***:
	* Septic arthritis (red, hot, angry, WBC >50K on joint tap)
	* Lyme Disease (may or may not have seen tick or noticed other Lyme symptoms)
	* Endocarditis (persistent fever and positive cultures)
	* Rheumatic Fever (h/o strep throat)
	* Transient Synovitis (h/o recent URI)
* ***Inflammatory/Autoimmune***:
	* Lupus
	* JIA
	* sJIA

## Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis 
* International League Against Rheumatism (ILAR) →  6 sub-categories+ “undifferentiated” category (not shown)
* Controversy as to whether  juvenile and adult inflammatory arthritides should be considered distinct from each other based on genetic and clinical parallels

**Definitions**:

* ***JIA***: Clinical diagnosis based on having objective signs of arthritis in ≥1 joint for ≥ 6 weeks in a child < 16 after other types of childhood arthritis have been excluded
* ***Oligoarticular***: up to 4 joints affected in first 6 months after diagnosis. Can be “persistent” or “extended”, based on whether stays limited past the 6 month mark
* ***Polyarticular***: affects more than 5 joints in first


|Subtype|Age|F: M|% JIA|Pattern|Extra-articular/Notable Features|Treatment|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Systemic**|1-5|1:1|5-15|Polyarticular (U/L ext, neck, hips)|Recurrent fever and evanescent rash; organ dysfxn; MAS, *note uveitis rare in this population|NSAIDS, MTX, IL-1 inhibitor, IL-6 inhibitor|
|**Oligo**|2-4|5:1|30-50|Knee, ankle, wrist, elbow|<5 joints|Uveitis|NSAIDs, intra-articular steroids, methotrexate (MTX), anti-TNF|
|**Poly RF(-)**|2-4|8-12|3:1|10-30|Symmetric; small joints (e.g. hands)<br>>5 joints |Uveitis|NSAIDS, MTX, anti-TNF|

|**Enthesitis-related**|9-12|1:3|5-10|Sacroiliac/axial|IBD, HLA-B27 positivity|NSAIDS, steroids, sulfasalazine, anti-TNF

## Systemic JIA (Still’s disease)

* Complex pathogenesis:  autoimmune (genetic risk factor in MHC complex) vs. autoinflammatory (F=M, cyclic fevers, response to IL1 inhibitors) 
	* Fever and rash may precede chronic arthritis 
	* Early disease is mediated by inflammatory cytokines IL-1, IL-6 etc
	* Macrophage activation syndrome is a complication associated with sJIA 
	* ILAR classification: Arthritis in ≥1 joint with or preceded by fever for ≥2 weeks that manifests as a daily or “quotidian” in timing for at least 3 days + one or more of the following:
		* Evanescent erythematous rash (i.e. comes and goes, often worse with fever)
		* Lymphadenopathy
		* Hepato/splenomegaly
		* Serositis

**Treatment**:

* Cytokine inhibitors can attenuate disease progression (ie.anakinra and canakinumab)
* For patients that develop chronic arthritis, co-stimulatory blockade of T-cells has anecdotally provided benefit (e.g. abatacept)

## Macrophage Activation Syndrome (MAS)

* A secondary form of hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)
* Dysregulation of the immune system with ineffective cytotoxic T and NK cell response leading to cytokine storm and over activation of macrophages 
* Can occur with most systemic/rheumatic disorders (ie KD, SLE) OR in the setting of viral illnesses such as EBV 
* Incidence is much higher in sJIA (~10-20%)
* PRINTO diagnostic criteria for MAS in SJIA:
	* Fever and serum ferritin > 684ng/mL + any two of the following:
		* Platelet count ≤ 181*109/L
		*  AST (>48U/L)
		* Triglycerides > 156mg/dl
		* Fibrinogen ≤ 360 mg/dl

## Autoinflammatory Diseases
**Autoimmune vs. Autoinflammatory**

* In broad strokes, autoinflammatory conditions are thought to be due to disruptions in innate immunity, whereas autoimmune conditions are due to disruptions in immune tolerance/adaptive immunity
* Autoinflammatory conditions often have mutations in genes related to the inflammatory cascade leading to uncontrolled inflammation with high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, fevers + rashes, and a similar incidence in males and females; biologics that block IL-1 and IL-6 can be helpful
* Autoimmune conditions may have auto-antigens and auto-reactive T-cells and B-cells; fever is not a core feature, although may be present; usually F>M; drugs that inhibit T-cells and B-cells are more useful (e.g. calcineurin inhibitors, MTX, rituximab)
* These divisions are not black and white, and most diseases are thought to lie on the spectrum and/or develop in immune pathophysiology over time (see sJIA)


**Diagnosis**

* Careful H&P (r/o malignancy, infection, cyclic neutropenia) → may confirm w/targeted genetic testing


**Categories**

* Includes both periodic fever syndromes as well as non-periodic fever syndromes

### Periodic Fever Syndromes

||FMF <br> (Familial Mediterranean Fever)|TRAPS <br> (TNF Rec.-associated Periodic Syndrome)| HIDS <br>(Hyper IgD Syndrome a.k.a. Mevalonate kinase deficiency (MDK))|MWS <br> (Muckle Wells Syndrome)| PFAPA <br> (Periodic Fever, Aphthous stomatitis, Pharyngitis, cervical adenitis)|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Inherit**.|AR|AD|AR|AD|Sporadic|
|**Protein Defect**|Pyrin|TNF receptor|Mevalonate kinase|Cryopryrin| Unknown|
|**Ethnicity**|Jewish, Turkish, Italian, Arab| Any|Dutch, French|Northern European|Any|
|**Flare Duration**|1-3 days|>7-14 days|3-7 days|2-3 days|3-4 days|
|**Interval Between Events**|Variable|Variable (days- wks)|Fixed (4-8 wks)|Variable <br>URI trigger|Fixed (2-8 wks)|
|**Age of Onset**|School age|School age|Infancy|School age| Early childhood|
|**Clinical**|Serositis<br>Peritonitis<br>Renal amyloidosis (if untreated)|Eye stuff (periorbital edema/pain, conjunctivitis)<br>Limb pain<br>Abdominal pain<br>Amyloidosis<br>Rash|LAD<br>Abdominal pain<br>Diarrhea<br>Arthralgias<br>Vomiting<br>Oral Ulcers<br>Developmental Delay (with complete enzyme deficiency)|Sensorineural hearing loss<br>Recurrent hives<br>Amyloidosis|Multiple fever spikes per a day<br>Sore throat<br>Mouth sores<br>Cervical LAD|
|**Treatment**|Colchicine<br>IL-1 inhibitor (if resistant to colchicine)|Steroids<br>Etanercept<br>Some evidence for IL-1 inhibitors|NSAIDS/GCs/IL-1 inhibitor during attacks<br>IL-1 blockade or etanercept for maintenance|IL-1 Inhibitor|Steroids<br>Tonsillectomy|

### Autoinflammatory Disorders without Periodic Fever
* Chronic recurrent multifocal osteomyelitis (CRMO)
	* Multifocal, non-infectious osteomyelitis, diagnosed with whole body MRI
	* Pts may only be symptomatic in one location, making dx difficult 
	* Red flags for CRMO (vs. infectious OM) include: clavicular lesions, bilateral/symmetric lesions, concurrent spondylarthritis/IBD/psoriasis/palmoplantar pustulosis, or OM that never had positive cultures and is persistently unresponsive to antibiotics
* Deficiency of the interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (DIRA)
* Pyogenic arthritis, pyoderma gangrenosum, and acne (PAPA)
* Juvenile systemic granulomatosis (Blau Syndrome)
* Chronic atypical neutrophilic dermatitis w/ lipodystrophy and elevated temperature (CANDLE)
