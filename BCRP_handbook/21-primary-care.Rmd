**Milestones from Bright Futures and CDC**

Early Intervention is responsible for assessing developmental delays and providing appropriate support in children birth through 2 years and 9 months. The Public School System is responsible for assessing deficits and providing appropriate support after 2.9 years. Their initial assessment is called a “TEAM evaluation”. An Individualized Education Plan (IEP) is developed after the TEAM evaluation.

## Red Flags
**REGRESSION** (loss of skills) & **PARENTAL CONCERN** are red flags at any age

- Asymmetry

- Idiosyncratic speech, disordered sequence of development

- Poor intelligibility for age

- Abnormal tone or movement patterns at any age, spasticity, hypotonia, absent DTRs

- Persistent primitive reflexes

- Lack of developmentally appropriate response to visual stimuli

- Immature play (like younger child)

- Stereotypic play; lack of pretend

- School failure (either for specific subjects like reading or math, or generalized)

- Always check vision and hearing if any concerns – can be assessed as young as newborn

- Emotional dysregulation

- Abnormal attachment patterns (over-clingy, indiscriminate)

- Using one hand exclusively at any age

- Problems w/ feeding and/or swallowing

Age-Specific:

- Speech/language eval if needed 

- Labs/imaging if risk factors for alternate organic diagnosis:
  - Blood lead levels, TSH, neuroimaging, EEG

### Considerations Prior to Initiating Pharmacotherapy

- Age: If <6, start with short acting and ensure they are also in behavioral therapy

- Make sure to document baseline height, weight, BP, HR and allergies

- Make sure to ask about personal hx of substance use, can consider nonstimulant or vyvanse (prodrug, thus lower abuse potential) if hx of SUD 

- Take a thorough history including personal hx of cardiac disease,  epilepsy, tics  or comorbid psychiatric conditions and family hx of cardiac disease or sudden cardiac death

  - If any concerning cardiac personal or family hx: obtain ekg and consider discussion with cardiology prior to starting stimulant medications

- Consider subspecialty consultation if age <6, significant psychiatric comorbidities, cardiac concerns, hx of epilepsy or tourette syndrome

\* See medication chart below for more information about common ADHD medications

### Follow Up
See patient for dose titration follow up every 1-2 weeks

- Up titrate dose until symptom remission, max FDA approved dose or patient experience treatment limiting side effects

- If patient is experiencing significant side effects or not having symptom remission can switch drug class (ie methylphenidate to amphetamine)

- If patient is well controlled in the AM and experiencing relapse of symptoms in afternoon, can consider adding in afternoon short acting medication 

- Make sure to document height, weight, BP and HR at each follow up visit

- Repeat vanderbilt forms once patient at stable dose of medication 

- All children with ADHD qualify for a 504 

- Provide a diagnosis letter to school See patient in clinic every 3-6 months once at stable dose of medication with tolerable side effects

### General Prescribing Principles

- In children 6 years and older, long-acting formulations are first line (improved compliance, lower abuse potential

- In children <6 years, short-acting formulations are first line. In this age group, medication should always be used in conjunction with therapy.

- Increase dose until either 1) symptoms are in remission, 2) patient encounters dose-limiting side effects, or 3) maximum daily dose is reached

- Before switching medication class 1)  maximize dose, 2) optimize dosing schedule, and 3) manage side effects

## Anxiety

### Types of Anxiety Disorders
Selective mutism, separation anxiety disorder, phobias, OCD, social anxiety disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder

- Important to screen in patients with ADHD and to screen for ADHD in those with anxiety--often linked

### How to Screen
PSC-17 (Pediatric Symptom Checklist): 4+ year olds

- Looks at psychosocial functioning, externalization and internalization
SDQb (Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire): 3 year olds +

- Sensitivity: 63% to 94% for emotional symptoms

- Specificity: 88% to 98% conduct problems

- Separate scale assesses impact of symptoms on global functioning
ASQ-SE (Ages and stages questionnaire—social emotional): 6-60 months

- Screens for social-emotional communicative, motor, problem- problems 
- Sensitivity: 71% to 85%

- Specificity: 90% to 98%

### Positive Screening

Obtain detailed hx re: symptoms, freq, duration, severity, degree of distress or interference

Consider SW involvement as needed

Behavioral Health/Psych referral

### Initial treatment (school aged)

CBT

Fluoxetine 10 mg daily - can uptitrate to 20 mg daily

**What if symptoms persist?** (school age): SSRI treatment in consult w/ psych, see medication table below for further recommendations

## Depression

### Background

Extremely significant cause of morbidity/mortality in children, >⅓ children experience a psychiatric disorder by childhood.

Cormorbidity with ADHD very common, important to screen for both.

Many types but most often will see:

1. Unipolar major depression (MDD): at least 2 weeks of depression plus 4 neurovegetative symptoms, no hx of mania

2. Persistent depressive disorder (Dysthmia): depression for  >2 years and at least 2 other symptoms (or MDD that persists for 2 years+)

### Neurovegetative Symptoms (SIGECAPS)

**S**leep disruption

**I**nterest deficit

**G**uilty Feelings

**E**nergy deficit

**C**oncentration deficit

**A**ppetite disorder

**P**sychomotor Changes

**S**uicidality

### How to Screen
Always screen for history of mania or bipolar symptoms (25-30% of Bipolar Disorder starts with depressive episode)

- Use PSC internalizing scale for anxiety/depression

- PHQ-9

\* Important to consider referral to psychiatrist for severe symptoms, significant comorbidities and for children <12

### Therapy
Should always be concurrent with starting medications (or offered), particularly in younger children. See tables below re medication management

### Follow Up

Follow up 2 wks after initiation and then 2-4 wks after, monitoring closely.

Most symptom improvement in 6-8 wks with some mild effects seen at 2 wks.

## Medication Management: Anxiety and Depression

### Side Effects/Precautions with SSRI use (see chart below for medication recs)
Black box warning: 

- Increase in suicidality/self harm after dose initiation or increase in dose

- Important to monitor closely during any initiation or changes

- Often suicidality exists prior to starting medication and important to assess prior and during medication management 

SSRI Activation Syndrome/Induced Mania

- Irritability, restlessness, agitation, impulsivity, hyperactivity, manic symptoms, psychosis

- Often emerges with initiation of SSRI or dose increase

- Risk higher in younger children and those at risk for bipolar disorder

QTc prolongation/cardiac events seen in escitalopram and citalopram in particular, consider closer monitoring or avoiding in patients with cardiac history

Avoid Wellbutrin in patients with eating disorders or seizure history

- Important to do good diet history prior to initiation given common disordered eating, particularly in adolescents

Serotonin syndrome

Most common mild side effects: GI, HA, sleep disturbances

### Anxiety
