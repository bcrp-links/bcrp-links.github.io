Intern fills out and presents Eating Disorder worksheet (will be reviewed on the first day) Do NOT write notes daily, but expected to examine patients daily, present thoughtful plans, and write an event note should something significant happen in a given 24hr period 3.2 Adolescent Clinic Tips 3.2.1 Overview Goal skills Taking an effective social history Addressing confidentiality Discussing topics such as sex, contraception, substance use, and weight Performing respectful genital exams Strength-based approaches to management Format Scheduled w/ same preceptor multiple times at BCH and BMC Try to schedule patients for return visits w/ you for continuity 3.2.2 BCH Adolescent Clinic Specifics Population 11-25 yo Primarily from the Greater Boston Area and surrounding suburbs Primary and Subspecialty care for patients with eating disorders, reproductive endocrine concerns, and chronic fatigue Primary languages spoken: English and Spanish Resources available: Mental health Psychopharm support Nutrition Resource specialist for social needs On-site sexual health counselling and STD testing (including HIV) 3.2.3 BMC Adolescent Clinic Specifics Population 12-22 yo Primarily from Dorchester, Roxbury, Hyde Park, South Boston, and the South End Primary care, first point of medical contact for adolescents new to the United States, and subspecialty care for teen parents, adolescents with substance use disorders, gender diversity, individuals s/p sexual assault, and menstrual disorders Primary languages spoken: English, Haitian Creole, Spanish, and Cape Verdean Creole Subspecialty programs &amp; Resources available CATALYST (for adolescents and young adults w/ substance use) Teen and Tot programs (to serve young parents and their children) CATCH (providing gender affirming care to youth of all ages) Sexual assault follow-up clinic Menstrual Disorders Clinic Integrated behavioral health social workers, patient navigators, and a family planner 3.3 HEEADSSS Assessment1 Parents, family members, or other involved adults should NOT be present during the HEEADSSS interview. Addressing this and the need for confidentiality at the beginning of the visit is important. Before asking adults to leave the room, always ask whether they have any concerns to express or questions to ask and assure them of further interaction once the confidential interview is over. Sometimes having a confidential moment with the adult can also be very informative to the patients care. Consider starting your HEEADSSS assessment by asking about the patients strengths. A simple question such as What are your greatest strengths can go a long way in rapport building and eliciting motivations to engage in healthy behavior change. Bold (green) = essential questions Italics (blue) = as time permits Plain text (red) = optional or when the situation requires 3.3.1 Home Where do you live? Who lives w/ you?

Much cheaper w/ Rx. - Safe to call in a prescription w/o pregnancy test or seeing patient Copper IUD (Paragard) - Most effective form of EC (&gt;99%), effective up to 7 days after unprotected sex - Can provide up to 12 years of highly effective contraception after placement Must be placed in a clinic setting by a trained provider For more information on emergency contraception (EC), please see the following resources: Bedsider, reproductiveaccess.org, Mass.gov EC site 3.5.2 Shared Decision Making (SDM) Collaborative process, allows patients and their providers to make healthcare decisions together, taking into account the best scientific evidence available, as well as the patients values and preferences Provider role: knowledge of the medical information Patient role: expert regarding their own values and preferences 3.5.3 Applying SDM Principles to Contraceptive Counseling Visits 3.5.3.1 Establish rapport What brings you in today? Whats happening with your birth control? Why did you decide to choose ____? Ask interactive open-ended questions. The HEEADSSS assessment is a great way to establish rapport for new patients. 3.5.3.2 Assess patient readiness What are important features that your birth control should have? What did you like/dislike about the birth control methods you used in the past? Different types of birth control affect your period differently. Some make your period a bit heavier, lighter, sporadic, or may take your period away. Which do you think will be best for you? 3.5.3.3 Tailor information and discussion to patient preferences/needs Your patient says they want a method where they will still have a regular period. Counsel them on the contraceptive ring, patch, pill, and copper IUD and NOT on the shot, implant, or LNG IUDs. Your patient says they want a method that is easy to keep private. Counsel them on the contraceptive implant, shot, IUD, and ring and NOT on the pill or patch. Your patient has heavy periods and doesnt want them to be any heavier. Provide information on any method other than the copper IUD. Your patient says they absolutely want to have a period every month. Provide more information on the LNG 15 and 19.5mg IUDs, and Copper IUD, and NOT the LNG 52mg IUD (Mirena). Use patients identified preferences for discussing particular methods. Being knowledgeable of contraceptive mechanisms of action, side effects, and delivery routes is important to provide this tailored information. 3.5.3.4 Discuss contraception side effects Patients who begin the birth control pill may have breast tenderness or a mild headache during the first month. These usually go away. With the LNG 52mg IUD, you may have spotting for about 4 months after placement, then your period will become lighter. After a year with the IUD, some patients stop getting their period. Many patients feel they do not receive adequate information about side effects, and that providers often overlook possible side effects in counseling discussions. It is important to discuss the specific side effects that patients should expect with the contraception type that is aligned with their preferences. 3.5.3.5 Identify misconceptions about specific contraception methods Im sorry that your friend had a bad experience with the vaginal contraceptive ring and weight gain. This isnt typical with most ring users. I support you in using this method because it aligns with your preferences. If you experience weight gain, you can absolutely choose a different option. I hear your concern that your friend had worsening acne with her IUD. We usually dont see this in the majority of patients, so its not likely that it will happen to you. Respectfully addressing myths or misconceptions about IUD types helps to keep conversations open, while providing patients with accurate information. 3.5.3.6 Ensure access to method discontinuation at any time If you decide you dont like this birth control, you can switch to something else at any time. If you decide that you want to stop your birth control, Im always here to talk about it and to support you. If for whatever reason you decide that you dont want the IUD anymore, I will remove it. Patients should be informed at the time of insertion that they can have their IUD removed at any time, and for any reason. IUD removal should be provided with the immediacy as same-day IUD placement is provided.

Primary and secondary w/ normal secondary sex characteristics: Urine pregnancy; FSH; Testosterone level; prolactin level  if elevated, need MRI of head to evaluate for prolactinoma; Progestin withdrawal test: Positive response indicates the production of estrogen w/o normal cycling such as in PCOS (if evidence of hyperandrogenism or elevated testosterone). Negative test w/ low FSH suggests low estrogen state as is seen in hypothalamic amenorrhea from nutritional deficiency. Negative test w/ high FSH indicates ovarian insufficiency. 3.12.6 Management PCOS: hormonal contraception or cyclical provera 10mg/day x 10d to induce bleeding Irreversible hypopituitarism or ovarian insufficiency: Premarin 0.625-2.5 mg/day or transdermal estrogen and Provera 10mg/day medroxyprogesterone 10-14 days per month. Hypothalamic amenorrhea related to nutritional deficiency: energy re-balance/weight restoration 3.13 Gender Affirming Care 3.13.1 Why One of our roles as providers of gender diverse youth is to combat the adverse experiences and risk factors for developing mental health disorders by building safe communities for our patients and adopting a gender affirming approach to care. 3.13.2 How Call patients by the name and pronouns that they tell you best describe them in all clinical settings. Build our lexicon to help lead our co-workers by example in using appropriate and non-stigmatizing language to affirm the childs or adolescents authentic self and gender identity (see gender-bread person below for review of terminology). Ask about gender identity at routine healthcare visits. Individuals who identify as transgender have higher rates of depression, anxiety, eating disorders, self-harm, and suicide compared to their cis-gendered peers. Screen for these when the opportunity arises and provide appropriate referrals/supports PRN. 3.13.3 Gender Affirming Care Clinics At BMC: CATCH At BCH: GeMs 3.13.4 The Genderbread Person knitr::include_graphics(&quot;./images/adolescent_genderbread-person.png&quot;) 3.14 Eating Disorders (ED) 3.14.1 Anorexia Nervosa (AN) 3.14.1.1 PowerPlans / Order Sets / EBGs Restrictive Eating Power Plan and Admission Orderset Restrictive Eating EBG 3.14.1.2 Definition Restriction of energy intake relative to requirements, leading to a significantly low body weight in the context of age, sex, developmental trajectory, and physical health Significantly low weight is defined as a weight that is less than minimally normal or, for children and adolescents, less than minimally expected Intense fear of gaining weight or of becoming fat, or persistent behavior that interferes w/ weight gain, even though at a significantly low weight Disturbance in the way in which ones body weight or shape is experienced, undue influence of body weight or shape on self-evaluation, or persistent lack of recognition of the seriousness of the current low body weight 3.14.1.3 Clinical Manifestations Weight loss, abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, cold intolerance, lanugo, fatigue, weakness, delayed puberty 3.14.1.4 Physical Exam Low body temp, bradycardia, low blood pressure, orthostasis, lanugo, dry skin and hair, scalp hair thinning, scaphoid abdomen, palpable stool, breast atrophy, hypoestrogenized vaginal mucosa 3.14.1.5 Evaluation Labs: CBCd, UA, urine pregnancy, chem 10, LFTs, TFTs, and EKG Weight: Compared to prior growth charts; calculate IBW based off of 50% BMI for age (unless previously tracking on different percentile) 3.14.1.6 Inpatient Management Restrictive Eating protocol If 18yo+, then must sign contract in ED agreeing to protocol Goal is to medically stabilize (weight &gt;80% of IBW), VSS (HR &gt;50, no longer orthostatic), electrolytes stable (monitor potassium, phos and mag) Refeed gradually to target meal plan while monitoring for refeeding syndrome (watch for edema, low phos) Weight increase of 0.2kg/day, supplement if not gaining weight; 1750-2000kcal diet to be increased by 250 kcal per day until goal calories met, meals per EBG (set time for meal, replace w/ 120% ensure if &lt;75% complete (either PO or via NG)) Check electrolytes daily and supplement w/ PhosNaK and/or MVI if abnormal (at BCH the protocol is to start both supplements on admission) Activity: Bed rest while orthostatic.
