Dear BCRP,

This is the fourth edition of the BCRP Handbook. It is based upon contributions from generations of residents past. It is intended to be an on-the-fly reference for residents that sharpens clinical knowledge, bolsters clinical efficiency, and ultimately improves patient care.

\textbf{ALL CLINICAL INFORMATION CONTAINED HEREIN IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE.} \textbf{Medication dosing, in particular, depends on indication and clinical situation.} Please double-check using evidence-based resources (i.e.~clinical pathways, UpToDate, Lexicomp) before entering orders.

In addition to the resident authors of years past and the many resident and faculty reviewers listed in the Table of Contents, we would like to send an enormous thank you several other key members of our team:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Thank you to \textbf{Erin Elbel} and \textbf{Zach Winthrop}, the editors of the prior handbook iteration, for your invaluable insight and support throughout this process
\item
  Thank you to \textbf{Mara Alexeev}, who served as the primary tech support for the handbook, who immediately grasped the vision for the handbook and brought the e-book version to life
\item
  Thank you to \textbf{Mohsin Ali}, \textbf{Patrick Asselin}, \textbf{Michael Duyzend}, \textbf{Colby Chiang}, and \textbf{Joshua Mayourian}, our incredibly talented resident tech advising team
\item
  Thank you to \textbf{Ted} \& \textbf{Kate}, who supported the production of this handbook and encouraged us to dream big, and to our faculty advisor, \textbf{Carolyn Marcus}
\item
  Thank you to the many resident reviewers who provided fantastic suggestions and feedback
\end{itemize}

We hope you enjoy using this book and that it lives on as a helpful resource for many generations of residents to come!

Sincerely,

Emily Harris \& Delia O'Shea

Co-Editors-in-Chief, BCRP Handbook 4.0

\textbf{Medications to Avoid in Children with Neuromuscular Disease}

Recall that the use of succinylcholine for intubation of children w/ neuromuscular diseases may trigger life-threatening conditions, such as hyperkalemia or malignant hyperthermia. Several commonly used drugs, such as aminoglycosides, have intrinsic neuromuscular blocking activity that can worsen respiratory muscle weakness.

Parents, family members, or other involved adults should \textbf{NOT} be present during the HEEADSSS interview. Addressing this and the need for confidentiality at the beginning of the visit is important. Before asking adults to leave the room, always ask whether they have any concerns to express or questions to ask and assure them of further interaction once the confidential interview is over. Sometimes having a confidential moment with the adult can also be very informative to the patient's care.

Consider starting your HEEADSSS assessment by asking about the patient's \textbf{strengths}. A simple question such as ``What are your greatest strengths'' can go a long way in rapport building and eliciting motivations to engage in healthy behavior change.

\textbf{GI}: chronic diarrhea.

\textbf{Derm}: Atopic and non-atopic dermatitis, severe diaper rash, neonatal rash, anhydrosis, as well as delayed separation of the umbilical cord (LAD)

\textbf{Immuno}: Recurrent infections, autoimmunity Family history of consanguinity or family history of immunodeficiency or unexplained childhood deaths puts a child at higher risk of having or developing a primary immunodeficiency

\textbf{Vital signs}: Growth parameters

\textbf{General exam}: Note dysmorphisms, including teeth and hair (abnormal in NEMO). Look for infectious sources (sinusitis, otitis, pneumonia, thrush, diaper rash)

\textbf{HEENT exam}: Note tonsils (absent in XLA) and examine for thrush and other signs of infection such as sinusitis or recurrent otitis media

\textbf{CV exam}: Note any cardiac anomalies including heart sounds, pulses, perfusion, and overall volume status as cardiac anomalies can be a part of certain syndromes associated w/ immunodeficiency syndromes (e.g.: DiGeorge Syndrome)

\textbf{Respiratory}: Note symmetry of lung exam, quality of air entry, and lung sounds as pulmonary anomalies may be a manifestation of immunodeficiency syndromes

\textbf{GI}: A thorough GI exam including abdominal exam for elements like hepatosplenomegaly and rectal exam for possible anal atresia is important

\textbf{GU}: Primary immunodeficiencies can also lead to GU anomalies; assess for absence/presence of appropriate male/female organs in the correct number

\textbf{Derm exam}: Skin exam for eczema/dermatitis (i.e.~WAS, SCID, hyper IgE syndrome) as well as erythroderma (Omenn Syndrome). Note telangiectasia (AT), warts, granulomas, poor wound healing or ulcers

\textbf{Neuro}: A thorough neuro exam may also hint at the etiology of an immunodeficiency (ataxia-telangiectasia), an infection such as meningitis, or may help elucidate an alternate cause of symptoms

\hypertarget{diagnosis-1}{%
\subsection{Diagnosis}\label{diagnosis-1}}

\textbf{Initial labs}: CBC w/ differential (note especially lymphopenia), chem7, albumin, urinalysis, ESR, CRP, quantitative immunoglobulins (IgG, IgA, IgM, IgE), specific vaccine antibody studies (tetanus, HiB, pneumococcal).

\textbf{Follow-up labs}: HIV testing. B- and T-cell subset, complement screening (C3, C4, AH50, CH50), vaccine challenge (administer pneumococcal or other vaccine and measure titers 4-6 weeks later), Dihydrorhodamine (DHR) assay (CGD). Leukocyte adhesion defect testing (LAD).

\textbf{Advanced lab analysis}: T cell proliferation studies (mitogen, antigen), T and B cell memory panels, NK cell function assays, Toll-like receptor assays. Immunodeficiency genetic panel. Whole exome or whole genome sequencing.

\tightlist
\item
  See indications for testing/tests above.
\item
  Is antibiotic prophylaxis indicated?
\item
  Can they receive immunizations? If they can, have they mounted a sufficient immune response to vaccines (ie. do they need vaccine titers)?
\item
  Low threshold for antibiotic use in the event that infection is suspected.
\end{itemize}

Managing a sick immunodeficient patient:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Obtain blood culture and labs.
\item
  Give antibiotics/antivirals promptly.
\item
  Determine whether imaging/surgery is indicated (ie. drain an abscess).
\item
  Be aware of blood products given. Blood may need to be from CMV negative donors, filtered to remove WBCs, and irradiated.
\item
  Replace missing immune components (ie. IVIG)

  \textbf{1 Fellow:} Should be your first stop for everything. \textbf{Trust them!} They are fantastic and want to teach.
\item
  \textbf{4 Residents:} One will be on outpatient, one post-call (but will round), two there all morning
\item
  \textbf{Attendings} (usually 4-5 of them):

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{General Cardiology:} Most patients are usually on this team.
  \item
    \textbf{Heart Failure/Transplant:} You will always round w/ the attending on this team, sometimes there will be a fellow too.
  \item
    \textbf{BACH:} Adult congenital. You will round w/ the BACH attending and fellow.
  \item
    \textbf{Electrophysiology (EP):} You should see the fellow every day.
  \item
    \textbf{Pulmonary Hypertension:} You will occasionally have patients on this service and will round w/ the attending.
  \item
    \textbf{Primary Attending:} Cardiology is a team sport, meaning there are multiple physicians on the care team. This is the patient's longitudinal cardiologist who will check in periodically.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Of note, there is also an \textbf{NP team.} This team is separate from the MD team during the day, but \textbf{you will cross-cover them overnight and on weekends/holidays} (which means when you are overnight, you will need to signout to the NP team in the morning).
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{admissions}{%

You will have a few types of admissions. The main ones will be from the CICU, from the ED, and post-cath:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{CICU admission:} Go with fellow to 8S (bring a COW) to get sign-out directly from the team caring for the patient. Write transfer note, enter transfer accept order, and perform transfer med rec.
\item
  \textbf{ED admission:} Just like any other admission, except the cardiology fellow sees them in the ED and there is a consult note
\item
  \textbf{Post-cath:} Usually you won't get signout on this patient. The fellow will get some signout from the patient's primary cardiologist. Ask them for more information and do some chart review for more information.
\end{itemize}

They are AMAZING.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Will also send you a welcome email before the rotation w/ excellent resources. Try to read them!
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Fellow:} Cardiology is a great time to learn and the fellows are excited about the heart and want to teach. Don't be afraid to ask them questions about the physiology and pathophysiology.
\item
  \textbf{Attendings:} Similarly excited to teach. Many of them will bring a whiteboard on rounds and draw out the physiology of the patient. Feel free to ask them to do so if you want to learn more!

\item
  \textbf{Nurses:} They have been doing this for longer than we have and know these patients incredibly well. Ask them for tips as well. On midnight rounds, always say hello and ask them what they are worried about for each patient.
\item
  \textbf{Code cards:} Carry them w/ you. They have lots of great information on them!
\item
  \textbf{CICU:} They are right next door and can get over to the general cardiology floor very quickly. Don't be afraid to call them. Always better to over call than under call them.

  \tightlist
  \item
    ↑ in I, ↑ in aVF = axis between 0 and +90°
  \item
    ↑ in I, ↓ in aVF = axis between -90 and 0°

  Once you've identified axis quadrant, \textbf{find the most isoelectric limb lead:}

  \begin{itemize}

  \item
    The QRS axis is 90° away from the most isolelectric lead
  \item
    Normal axis varies w/ age (newborn = rightward b/c RV dominance in utero, childhood = leftward b/c LV becomes dominant)
  \item
    Superior axis = AV canal defects, tricuspid atresia and large VSD or left anterior hemiblock
  \item
    Leftward axis in a cyanotic newborn is highly suggestive of tricuspid atresia

\item
  The normal PR interval increases w/ age
\item
  Prolonged PR intervals are seen in AV nodal block (heart block)
\item
  Short PR intervals are seen in pre-excitatory conditions such as WPW
\item
  Variable PR interval can be seen in wandering atrial pacemaker, multifocal atrial tachycardia and Wenkebach-type 2nd degree heart block
\item
  Depressed PR segment may be seen in pericarditis
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{qrs-interval}{%

Ventricular depolarization

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The upper limit of normal increases w/ age (0.07 s in newborns to 0.12 s in adults)
\item
  A wide (prolonged) QRS is indicative of depolarization which proceeds independent of the His-Purkinje system or in which depolarization via the His-Purkinje system is aberrant
\item
  This is seen in ventricular arrhythmias, pre-excitation, IV conduction delays and BBB
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{qt-interval}{%
\subsubsection{QT interval}\label{qt-interval}}

Ventricular depolarization (QRS) and repolarization

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  QTc normalizes QT interval accounting for HR, calculated w/ Bazett formula: QT (sec) / √RR(sec)
\item
  A normal QTc in the newborn = 0.47 s, it shortens in older children to 0.44, and then elongates to the normal adult values of approximately 0.45 s in men and 0.46 s in women
\item
  Prolonged QTc is seen in congenital long QT syndrome, electrolyte derangements (hypokalemia, hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia), hypothermia and is caused or worsened by many medications
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{q-wave}{%
\subsubsection{Q wave}\label{q-wave}}

Ventricular septal depolarization, which proceeds from left-to-right and inferior-to-superior

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Small q waves should be seen in the inferior and left-facing leads (I,II,V5,V6 and III and aVF).
\item
  Duration should not exceed 0.04 sec and amplitude should not exceed 25\% of QRS wave in height
\item
  Abnormally tall or long Q-waves may represent ischemia
\item
  Q waves in V1 and V2 are \textbf{always abnormal}
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{u-wave}{%
\subsubsection{U wave}\label{u-wave}}

Small deflection often seen closely following the T wave, which may represent repolarization of the Purkinje fibers or after depolarizations w/i the ventricle

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  A U wave is a normal finding if it is small (\textless25\% the amplitude of the T wave), there is an isoelectric segment between the T wave and U wave, and if the U wave is upright
\item
  If any of these features are not met, the U wave may be pathologic
\item
  Prominent U waves are seen most often seen in hypokalemia, but can also be seen in other electrolyte derangements, ventricular hypertrophy, LQTS and w/ antiarrhythmic therapy
\item
  Inverted U waves are concerning for ischemia, ventricular hypertrophy or cardiomyopathy
\item
  U waves are often more prominent at slow heart rates (\textless65 bpm)
\item
  If U waves are large (\textgreater25\% of the T wave amplitude) and there is no isoelectric segment between the T wave and U wave, they should be included in the QTc calculation (which becomes the QTUc)
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{st-segment}{%
\subsubsection{ST segment}\label{st-segment}}

Ventricular repolarization

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Elevation or depression \textgreater1mm in limb leads or \textgreater2mm in precordial leads is abnormal and is concerning for ischemia if seen in a territorial distribution (especially w/ reciprocal changes in other territories) or pericarditis if diffuse
\item
  Concave ``smiling'' ST-elevation is often normal, as seen in benign early repolarization, however convex ``frowning'' ST-elevation is ominous
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{rs-progression}{%
\subsubsection{R/S progression}\label{rs-progression}}

R/S ratio represents the ratio of left to right ventricular forces. R waves in the right precordial leads represent depolarization of the right ventricle, and S waves in these leads represent depolarization of the left ventricle. Pattern reversed in left precordial leads.

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In newborn period of a FT infant, the RV is dominant and as such the R wave in lead V1 should be greater than the S wave
\item
  As a child ages, the LV becomes progressively more dominant until late adolescence when an adult-type R/S progression is seen w/ small R waves and large S waves in V1 w/ large R waves and small S waves in V6
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{t-waves}{%
\subsubsection{T waves}\label{t-waves}}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Normal T wave pattern varies w/ age

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    At birth, all T waves should be upright
  \item
    Over the first days of life, leads V1-V3 invert (V1 first, V3 last) and after 7-10 days of life it is pathologic for there to be upright T waves in lead V1 and represent RV strain if present
  \end{itemize}
\item
  It is normal for the T waves in leads V1-V3 to be inverted in children, and between the ages of \textasciitilde8-20yo these T waves start to become upright (V3 first, V1 last)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    However, it is not abnormal for T wave inversion to persist into an individual's 20s, and this is called a persistent juvenile T wave
  \end{itemize}
\item
  It is \textbf{always abnormal} to see an inverted T waves in leads V5 + V6 (ischemia or ventricular strain)
\item
  Peaked T-waves are seen in hyperkalemia and elevated ICP and abnormally flat in hypokalemia

\item
  \textbf{DDD:} Dual chamber pacing- provides more physiologic pacing w/ preserved AV synchrony and may be used in patients w/ both sinus node and AV node dysfunction. This mode of pacing can result in four different rhythms:

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation (HCT) is a powerful intervention that has the potential to cure numerous malignant and non-malignant disorders. For cancer, HCT allows high dose chemotherapy to be used +/- a graft-vs-leukemia effect (if allogeneic). For non-malignant disorders (hemoglobinopathy, immunodeficiency, primary HLH), the HCT can replace genetically defective cells with those that do not have the mutation.

As you can imagine, whether you are treating a malignant or non-malignant disorder fundamentally affects how you approach a transplant. For malignant disease, it is more important to use myeloablative conditioning (MAC) to try to completely eliminate all cancer cells. By contrast, when treating a non-malignant disorder, a mixed chimerism may sometimes be sufficient to provide functional cure, and reduced intensity conditioning (RIC) is an option. It is less about eliminating all patient bone marrow cells and more about sneaking in enough that work (note: if too few sneak in, they might be kicked out by patient = ``graft failure'').

With MAC, there is higher potential for graft-vs-host disease (GvHD), given the high amounts of inflammation that occur, which is usually a precipitating factor for the GvH response. There are also more long-term sequelae of aggressive chemotherapy.

RIC is theoretically gentler with regards to GvHD and chemotoxicity. However, as mentioned, it increases the risk of graft failure, which is a scenario where the patient rejects the graft and can lead to disease recurrence with autologous recovery (bad) or pancytopenia (also bad).

The major risks of transplant are: chemotoxicity, veno-occlusive disease (VOD), transplant associated thrombotic microangiopathy (TA-TMA), infection, GvHD, and graft failure. We will try to outline the clinical and laboratory signs of these complications in the coming sections, along with the approximate time period after transplant one might expect them. Treatments shown reflect common practice at DFCI, but there is considerable variation across institutions.

Overall, transplant outcomes have significantly improved over the past few decades. While we see the sickest patients in our ICU, there are many we don't see that are now thriving at home.

The cell therapy field is also witnessing some exciting innovations. Using gene editing, there are gene-corrected autologous HCTs being tested for a variety of monogenic disorders. Cytotoxic T lymphocyte therapies are being refined for viremia that is refractory to standard treatment. And, of course, how could we fail to mention CAR T?

  CMV, EBV, and ADV are common viruses that can have high morbidity/mortality in immunocompromised patients that are s/p HCT
\item
  Current antiviral therapies like cidofovir \& valganciclovir may tackle viremia, but they do not address the root cause, which is the lack of virus-specific T cells; this is where CTLs can help
\item
  Steps to making a CTL therapy

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Matched donor or third party donor provides peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs)
  \item
    These are exposed to viral antigens in vitro
  \item
    Virally activated T-cells are isolated from the T-cell milieu, expanded, and infused into patient
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Because T-cells are mostly specific to virus, there is less GvHD than with an unselected donor lymphocyte infusion
\item
  To increase efficiency of manufacturing, tri-valent CTLs (specific to CMV, EBV, \& ADV) are under investigation

  What is a CAR?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Synthetic protein construct
  \item
    Extra-cellularly, there is a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) that recognizes tumor cell surface antigens
  \item
    Intracellularly, there is a co-stimulatory domain (e.g.~CD28, 4-1BB, ICOS) that provides the necessary co-stimulation signal and a T-cell intracellular signaling domain (CD3z)
  \item
    The extra- and intra-cellular domains are connected by a transmembrane fragment
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Who gets it?

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    At DFCI, CAR T is used as a bridge to transplant; ideally a patient with leukemia will be ``minimal-residual-disease'' (MRD) negative and then get a HCT as consolidation therapy
  \item
    However, if they are MRD+, CAR T can be used to get them into full remission before HCT; other places may not proceed to HCT\ldots it is so new that we are still getting the data for what recommendations should be

  Provides inspiratory pressure (\textbf{IPAP}) (compared to PIP), and expiratory pressure (\textbf{EPAP}) (compared to PEEP). Can also adjust FiO2 to improve oxygenation.

  \textbf{Mechanism:} In addition to alveolar recruitment, delta pressure (IPAP - EPAP) influences tidal volume to improve ventilation (Minute Ventilation = Tidal Volume x Respiratory Rate). IPAP can also reduce work of breathing.
\item
  \textbf{Indications:} Hypoxic, hypercarbic or mixed respiratory failure
\item
  \textbf{Considerations:} Although you can set a mandatory breath rate in certain BiPAP modes, machine breaths that are not aligned w/ patient efforts do not result in good tidal volumes due to the noninvasive interface; therefore \textbf{not a good choice} for patients w/ inconsistent respiratory drive. \textbf{Relatively contraindicated} in patients w/ altered mental status or who cannot protect their airway (ie. no cough or gag) from aspiration.

The efficacy of any topical medication is related to:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Active ingredient (inherent strength)
\item
  Concentration of medication
\item
  Anatomic location
\item
  Vehicle (mode in which it is transported)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Ointment:} (e.g.~Vaseline). Lubricating, semi-occlusive, greasy, does not sting. Useful for smooth, non-hairy skin, dry, thick or hyperkeratotic lesions.
  \item
    \textbf{Cream:} Less greasy, not occlusive, may sting, could cause irritation, vanish when rubbed in. Useful for acute exudative inflammation, intertriginous areas.
  \item
    \textbf{Lotion:} Less greasy, less occlusive, may sting, pourable liquid. Useful for acute exudative inflammation (e.g.~acute contact dermatitis) and on hairy areas.
  \item
    \textbf{Oil:} Less stinging, keratolytic (removes scale). Useful for the scalp, especially for people with coarse or very curly hair.
  \item
    \textbf{Gel:} May sting, greaseless, least occlusive, dries quickly. Useful for acne and on scalp/hairy areas without matting.
  \item
    \textbf{Foam:} Spreads readily, easier to apply, more expensive, cosmetically elegant. Useful for hairy areas and inflamed skin.
  \item
    \textbf{Spray:} Aerosols (rarely used), pump sprays
  \end{itemize}

  When deciding how much topical to prescribe, think in terms of lesion size and body surface area (BSA)

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    1 Finger Tip Unit (FTU) = 0.5 grams topical medication dispensed from a 5mm nozzle placed on pad of index finger from distal tip to DIP joint = 2 adult palms = 2\% BSA

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      \emph{Example:} How much topical medication should you Rx for 2\% BSA BID x30 days?

      \begin{itemize}
      \tightlist
      \item
        1 FTU = 0.5 grams = 2\% BSA
      \item
        0.5 grams x 2 times per day = 1 gram
      \item
        1 gram x 30 days = 30 grams
      \end{itemize}
    \end{itemize}

\textbf{Differential}

Important to maintain a broad differential diagnosis and think systematically.
Can use the mnemonic \textbf{VITAMINS}:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Vascular}: Stroke, cerebritis, migraine, vasculitis
\item
  \textbf{Infection}: Encephalitis, meningitis, brain abscess, sepsis
\item
  \textbf{Toxins/Trauma}: Environmental/Medication toxins, head trauma
\item
  \textbf{Accident/Abuse}: Epidural hematoma, large subdural, TBI (diffuse axonal injury)
\item
  \textbf{Metabolic}: Hypoglycemia, DKA, thyroid dysfxn, electrolyte abnormality, inborn error of metabolism, hypoxia, hypercarbia, renal, hepatic, endocrine
\item
  \textbf{Intussusception}: Somnolent variant
\item
  \textbf{Neoplasm}: Intracranial neoplasm, paraneoplastic syndrome
\item
  \textbf{Seizure}: Active seizure, subclinical status epilepticus, postictal state
\end{itemize}

Suspicion guided by age and history. Acute-onset altered mental status in an adolescent has a strong probability of being toxin-related.

\textbf{Approach}

Initial evaluation and stabilization:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Place on monitors, consider access
\item
  Primary Survey (ABCDE), point-of-care glucose
\item
  Secondary Survey (AMPLE History)

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    Allergies, Medications, PMHx, Last meal, Events preceding presentation
  \item
    Acute vs chronic change? How quickly did this occur?
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Continue to obtain more detailed history (including exposures, recent travel, possible medications in home, drug use, recent illnesses, possible inciting events, etc) while stabilizing
\item
  GCS \textless{} 8 often suggests the need for airway management and mechanical ventilation, but decision is case by case
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Physical Exam}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Thorough head to toe examination (including ABCs as above)
\item
  Detailed neurologic exam including fundoscopic exam if possible, mental status
\item
  Cardiorespiratory exam
\item
  Abdominal exam
\item
  Skin exam looking for rashes, signs of trauma
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Studies}

\textbf{\emph{Broad initial workup can include the following, but is strongly guided by history or lack thereof}}:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  CBC/d
\item
  BMP
\item
  LFTs
\item
  Ammonia
\item
  Drug screening: Urine Tox (extended opioid), urine marijuana, serum tox, APAP/ASA/EtOH levels
\item
  VBG
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\emph{Other workup can be tailored to H\&P and PE}}:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Blood culture, LP if concerned for infection and/or fever (*see Neuro section for meningitis management)
\item
  Abd US if concerned for intussusception
\item
  Head CT if concerned for trauma, acute hemorrhage, stroke, increased ICP
\item
  Consider coags and other tests for possible medication exposures
\item
  Detailed metabolic workup if concerned for underlying inborn error
\item
  EEG for seizure or subclinical status (though only useful in active seizure, manage ABCs are the priority)
\end{itemize}

Treatment is based on the depth of burn, proportion of TBSA involved, and if there is airway involvement or other injuries:

\textbf{Airway}
- Assess for signs of inhalation injury or respiratory distress, snoot in nares, carbonaceous sputum, stridor

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Consider intubation for \textgreater30\%TBSA burned
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Breathing}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Assume carbon monoxide poisoning with severe/closed space burns
\item
  Assess stability of the airway
\item
  If airway injury, early intubation (use smaller cuffed ETT than necessary for age given continued swelling that will occur)
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Circulation}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  For burns \textgreater15\%BSA or any evidence of inhalation → Parkland formula
\item
  Initial bolus of 20 cc/kg NS
\item
  Parkland fluid resuscitation formula: good estimate for losses, but underestimates needs of young children \textless5yo. Provides fluid requirements to be added in addition to normal maintenance fluid requirements
\item
  {[}TBSA burned (\%){]} x {[}wt (kg){]} x {[}4mL{]} = total mL resuscitation required over first 24 hrs → Give 1⁄2 in 1st 8 hours, remainder in next 16 hrs
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Assess urine output}:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Urine output \textless1mL/kg/hr → 20 mL/kg bolus of crystalloid
\item
  Urine output = 1-3 mL/kg/ht → continue parkland formula
\item
  Urine output \textgreater3 mL/kg/hr →decrease rate to 2/3 Parkland formula
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Pain control}

IV narcotic therapy often necessary (can give IM morphine or IN fentanyl prior to placing IV)

\textbf{Wound care}:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Cleanse affected area with lukewarm sterile water.
\item
  Wipe away loose tissue with sterile gauze
\item
  Leave unruptured bullae intact (do not rupture)
\item
  Topical antibiotics (Silvadene, Bacitracin) applied directly to burns

\hypertarget{avulsion}{%
\subsection{Avulsion}\label{avulsion}}

The tooth is completely displaced from the alveolar ridge; the periodontal ligament is severed, and fracture of the alveolus may occur. Extra-oral dry time \textless{} 60 minutes has an increased prognosis of saving the tooth. Primary (``baby'') teeth should not be replaced. If child cooperative, the tooth should be placed into the socket immediately (by the parent before arrival to care if possible). Otherwise, may be placed in a solution with order of preference: save-a-tooth \textgreater{} milk \textgreater{} normal saline. Solution should be chilled but tooth should not be placed directly on ice

\hypertarget{fracture}{%

\textbf{Infraction}: cracked tooth

\textbf{Enamel only (Ellis I - uncomplicated)}: tooth chipped, pain absent but may be elicited with manipulation.

\textbf{Enamel and dentin (Ellis II - uncomplicated)}: ``yellowish'', tooth chipped with exposed dentin, sensitive to touch and temperature. Cover exposed dentin with calcium hydroxide. Care within 48 hours

\textbf{Complicated crown fracture (Ellis III - complicated)}: ``reddish'', exposure of the pulp and central artery, increased risk of infection. Emergency dental evaluation

\textbf{Root fracture}: May not also involve the crown. If the crown is not involved, root fracture suggested by mobility of the crown

\textbf{Alveolar fracture}: causes dislocation of multiple teeth that move with palpation.

Indication for urgent Dental consult

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Avulsed permanent tooth (after reimplantation whenever possible)
\item
  Extrusion \textgreater3 mm or interfering with bite
\item
  Laterally luxated (displaced) teeth that interfere with bite (if not interfering with bite, will often spontaneously revert)
\item
  Intruded primary teeth
\item
  Fractured teeth when dental pulp is exposed (bleeding from central core of tooth)
\item
  Suspected dental root or alveolar fracture (e.g.~tooth mobility, pain out of proportion when tooth is wiggled)
\item
  Suspected jaw fracture (posterior tooth fracture, jaw tenderness, and/or malocclusion) to obtain panoramic radiographs
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{treatment-45}{%
\subsection{Treatment}\label{treatment-45}}

Reimplantation (while awaiting arrival of dental team\ldots)

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Avulsed permanent teeth should be reimplanted immediately, ideally within 15 minutes and up to one hour
\item
  Store in save-a-tooth (preferred, available in BCH ED pharmacy), cold milk or saliva if unable to reimplant
\item
  Handle the tooth carefully by the crown to prevent damage to the periodontal ligament
\item
  Remove debris by gentle rinsing with saline or tap water; do not attempt to sterilize or scrub the tooth
\item
  Reimplant manually
\item
  Keep the tooth in place by having the child hold it or bite on a gauze pad or clean towel.
\end{itemize}

Uncomplicated fracture of permanent tooth:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Store tooth fragments in tap water to prevent discoloration
\item
  Dental follow-up within a few days to bond fracture piece or smooth a fracture
  Other injuries (infraction, concussion, subluxation) warrant outpatient dental referral

To determine need for imaging (Head CT)

\textbf{For children less than 2 years}:

Any altered mental status or palpable skull fracture*

Other considerations:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Non-frontal scalp hematoma
\item
  LOC ≥5 seconds
\item
  Severe mechanism of injury**
\item
  Acting abnormally per parent
\end{itemize}

\textbf{For children 2 years and older}:

Any altered mental status or signs of a basilar skull fracture (retro-auricular or periorbital bruising, CSF otorrhea or rhinorrhea, hemotympanum)

Other considerations:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Any loss of consciousness
\item
  History of vomiting
\item
  Severe injury mechanism**
\item
  Severe headache
\end{itemize}

* If 1-2 of above is present, monitor 4-6 hours and obtain head CT if symptoms worsen or don't improve; If ≥3 above are present, head CT is recommended; If none is present, head CT not recommended

** Severe mechanism of injury: Motor vehicle crash with patient ejection, death of another passenger or rollover, pedestrian or bicyclist without helmet struck by motorized vehicle, falls (\textgreater3 feet children \textless{} 2 years or \textgreater{} 5 feet for children ≥ 2 years) or head struck by high impact object.

\hypertarget{treatment-49}{%

\end{itemize}

\textbf{Discharge Criteria}: Normal mental status, non-focal neuro exam, able to PO, no social concerns, not \textless1 mo with isolated skull fracture

Dx of concussion with negative imaging:

\begin{itemize}
\item
  DO NOT return to play same day, risk of second-impact syndrome (2nd injury before full recovery → possible cerebral vascular congestion → diffuse cerebral edema)
\item
  Physical rest: avoid strict ``bed rest,'' but limit activity to level that does not provoke/increase sx; sub-symptom threshold, aerobic exercise shown to decrease duration of sx
\item
  Cognitive rest: academic adjustments as needed to reduce symptom exacerbation

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Complete cognitive rest and avoidance of screen time NOT recommended}
  \item
    See Uptodate (``sample school note to guide academic accommodations for children and adolescents with concussion'') for template academic note
  \end{itemize}
\item
  PT for patients suffering from vestibular or oculomotor dysfunction
\item
  No sports until asymptomatic and cleared by a physician, emphasize individualized course, warn of possible persistent symptoms beyond 1 month (\emph{See Graduated Return-to-Sport Program})

Each diagnosis has its own specific management pearls (see below), but these general principles apply to all:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Pt/family \textbf{education} about FGIDs. Thorough \textbf{understanding} of diagnosis and clear \textbf{motivation} to overcome it is critical for patient and family. \textbf{Language} is important: Can be helpful to describe broadly as ``hyperactive/overly sensitive gut nervous system'' that needs to be ``re-trained''; the word ``functional'' may be off-putting, so alternatives might be ``sensitive stomach'' or ``irritable bowel'' (as appropriate depending on specific diagnosis). Most important is \textbf{reassurance} (e.g.~have ruled out other concerning diagnoses). Many families are actually accepting and feel relieved to put a name to the symptoms.
\item
  \textbf{Judiciously} order labs/imaging \textbf{only if} alarm symptoms are present and after introducing possibility of FGID.
\item
  \textbf{CBT:} Relaxation training, cognitive restructuring, modifying family response. Also important to \textbf{address other psychological comorbidities.}
\item
  \textbf{Antispasmodics} (hyoscyamine, dicyclomine). \textbf{TCAs or SSRIs} if comorbid anxiety/depression.
\item
  Identify and avoid \textbf{food triggers} (e.g.~tomatoes/citrus, caffeine, carbonation, greasy, spicy foods).
\item
  \textbf{Inpatient:} Consider Magic Mouthwash (AIOH/diphenhydramine/lidocaine/MgOH/simethicone) or hyoscyamine if ``something'' necessary (e.g.~over a weekend)

  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Opioids:}

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Management and prevention of opioid \textbf{side effects:}

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      \textbf{Constipation:} Standing stimulant laxative (senna) and daily Miralax w/ admit. Titrate for 1 soft formed stool q1-2d. Escalate PRN, may add Mg citrate, milk of magnnesia, lactulose, methylnaltrexone.
    \item
      \textbf{Pruritus and nausea:} Start w/ camphor-menthol lotion for mild itching. Next step is a naloxone drip at 0.5 mcg/kg/h, titrate up to 2 mcg/kg/h q3-4h for significant itching/nausea. Can then add Zofran. Avoid Benadryl given the sedating effect.
    \item
      \textbf{Prevent hypoventilation:} Crucially important in preventing atelectasis and ACS! Incentive spirometer 10x/hr while awake and q4h overnight. Bubbles or pinwheel in younger kids. HOB elevated to 30 degrees at all times. Have patient sit up in bed, out of bed to chair, and ambulation as tolerated. Standing albuterol q4-6h for pt w/ asthma, history of wheeze w/ prior VOE, chest or back pain, or any current wheezing or cough. Oxygen overnight PRN (goal O2 sat \textgreater{} 95\% or pt's known baseline; can provide NC O2 at 0.5-1L for mild desats while asleep; does not replace the need for incentive spirometry). Continue any home respiratory therapies (home O2, CPAP, etc).
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Titration of PCA/opioids:}

    \begin{itemize}
    \tightlist
    \item
      Use patient reported pain score (compare to baseline/chronic pain level) AND change in pain AND patient functional status to assess pain control
    \item
      Assess for VOE vs.~opioid side effects to help w/ dose adjustment
    \item
      Reassess pain control frequently, especially during first 24 hrs, and adjust PCA as needed w/ goal of providing 2/3 of total opioid dose as basal and 1/3 as demand
    \item
      Consider increasing basal rate by 20\% overnight early in the admission to avoid falling behind in pain control while asleep
    \item
      As pain is captured, wean PCA rate and then switch to orals
    \end{itemize}
  \item
    \textbf{Weaning to orals:} Please discuss patient specific plan w/ Pedi Heme; details will depend on length of admission, pain tolerance, and patient preference. In general, when pain is well-controlled, replace the basal PCA w/ SCHEDULED long- or short-acting oral medication (MS Contin, oxycodone, or hydromorphone), leaving the PCA demand button. If pain remains well-controlled after 12-24 hrs, then replace PCA demand w/ a standing short-acting medication (often oxycodone, tramadol, or hydromorphone). This step should be considered both a conversion and a wean.

\hypertarget{blood-transfusions-in-scd}{%
\subsection{Blood Transfusions in SCD}\label{blood-transfusions-in-scd}}

Blood transfusions in SCD are used to increase RBC mass and oxygen carrying capacity and to decrease proportion of sickle cells. Acute benefits of transfusion must be weighed against the long-term risks, including alloimmunization. Phenotypically matched (ABO, Rh-D, Kell, C, E), sickle negative, leuko-depleted irradiated packed red blood cells are the blood product of choice. More extensive phenotyping needed for patients on chronic transfusion. It may take hours for the blood bank to find matched blood, and even longer in cases of alloimmunization so maintain an active type and screen if you anticipate needing to transfuse a patient.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Bill's Pearls:} Think about the underlying metabolic \textbf{\emph{state}} of the patient!

The catabolic state precipitates most problems in decompensating metabolic diseases, anabolic support is focused on giving calories to stimulate insulin secretion and signaling. If someone is really sick and they are hyperglycemic (BG \textgreater{} 250 mg/dL), it would be better to give insulin than to cut the dextrose because the insulin will increase the anabolic support. If you have elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate (blood) or acetoacetate(urine) then you are in a catabolic state and at risk.

Similarly, don't be falsely reassured by correcting lab values. For instance, you can easily correct hypoglycemia, but the patient could still be catabolic and/or depleted of stores from their illness. They may still decompensate rapidly after therapy is weaned off.

  \textbf{Hydration:} 10 mL/kg NS bolus if dehydrated, then D10 NS + 20 mEq/L of KCl (add after ruling out hyperkalemia or after voiding) @ 1-1.5x M, avoid hyponatremia (predisposes to cerebral edema; minimum of 4-5 meq/kg/day of sodium in fluids)
\item
  \textbf{Nutrition:} give calories via carbs + IL alone (unless FA ox d/o is on ddx, then no IL) to provide 1-1.5x TEE (120-150 kcal/kg/day), preferably enteral nutrition (enteral carbs → portal vein → maximize insulin release); can give TPN if enteral feeds are not tolerated, start protein w/in 48h
\item
  \textbf{Promote anabolism:} nutrition, ↓ counter-regulatory hormones → ensure adequate volume, ondansetron for vomiting if not at risk of long QT, treat infxn/fever/pain, correct hypoglycemia (bolus of 2 or 5 mL of 25 or 10\% Dextrose → rule of 50 (i.e., vol*\%dex = 50), then infusion to maintain a GIR of 8-12 mg/kg/min {[}GIR in mg/kg/min = dextrose\% x Vol (ml/kg/day) / 144{]}), maintain normoglycemia if needed with insulin @ 0.1mcg/kg/hr, titrating to maintain glucose between 100-120mg/dL (goal of high GIR = get glucose (i.e., calories), into the cells rather than add to Sosm by causing hyperglycemia), wean GIR slowly to prevent rebound hypoglycemia

\textbf{Bill's Pearls:} Plasma AAs

A plasma amino acid panel can tell you if you need to give protein or not, if you see deficiency in multiple amino acids. You can only restrict protein for 24-48 hours before an amino acid deficiency develops. When there is an AA deficiency, the catabolic state is less responsive to dextrose-based anabolic support. In addition to protein synthesis, amino acids have other synthetic and regulatory roles (methionine -\textgreater{} methylation of DNA, synthesis of creatine; leucine -\textgreater{} stimulator of insulin secretion; cysteine -\textgreater{} antioxidant; etc.) you may not otherwise think about.

\textbf{Bill's Pearls:} high-level approach to Aminoacidopathies

Amino acid concentrations that get excessively elevated can cause cerebral edema (e.g.~leucine in MSUD, methionine in homocystinuria). Avoid excessive fluid administration if you think these states are present. The key is to provide metabolic formula that has caloric value and a mixture of amino acids that don't include the toxic ones (i.e.~branched-chain-free formula in MSUD). The goal is to make the toxic amino acid the limiting reagent in protein synthesis and to provide enough calories to stimulate protein synthesis. You don't get the same effect with dextrose-containing fluids and end up giving more volume.

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Bill's Pearls:} high-level approach to Mitochondrial disorders

Mitochondrial diseases don't decompensate acutely like small molecule metabolic diseases. Therapy is focused on decreasing systemic stressors (treat infection, stop catabolism, correct dehydration, etc). Try to \textbf{keep the bicarbonate \textgreater{} 16}, otherwise acidemia will impair mitochondrial function. The lactate levels will be what they are -- just keep the bicarbonate up and don't give too much dextrose (D5 ok, D10 negotiable). \textbf{Don't give valproic acid or Lactated Ringers.} Lactate gets the attention but cardiac dysfunction in acute scenarios is the concern. Cardiac cells that have poor mitochondrial function typically hypertrophy, leading to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and some preload dependence. You are never wrong to get an EKG and call cardiology. Correct dehydration to minimize perfusion-associated lactic acidemia.

If you think someone may have a mitochondrial disease, get a plasma amino acid level with a lactate. Look for elevated alanine as well, because of the high error associated with lactate due to blood draws. True metabolic acidemia should have an anion gap and acidic urine.

\textbf{Bill's Pearls:} UCD management

Children often look better than their ammonia level. \emph{Start anabolic support when they get to the ED!} If they don't have access, then get it as fast as you can. If they are not vomiting, protein-free formula run continuously through a G-tube provides more calories than IV fluid and is faster to get going.
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Acutely:} immediate treatment of hyperammonemia (see full details in Metabolic crisis management section): Stop all protein intake (but no longer than 36-48h), give dex-containing IVF (10-25\% @ 1.5xM) and IL (1-3 g/kg/d) through central line, NH3 scavengers (Ammonul = Na benzoate and Na phenylacetate) usually with IV arginine, avoid hypoNa (would exacerbate cerebral edema), prepare for HD (likely if NH3 \textgreater{} 300 μmol/L)

  Usually d/t underlying cause rather than symptoms from hyponatremia itself.
\item
  Sx occur when hyponatremia evolves acutely (\textless24h) \& include N/V/HA → seizures, coma, and respiratory arrest.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Workup}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Chem 10, serum Osm (↓ in true hyponatremia. If ↑, look for hyperglycemia or other osms)
\item
  UA (proteinuria, hematuria, glucosuria), urine Osm. If euvolemic, nl response to hyponatremia = suppress ADH → urine is maximally dilute (osmolality \textless{} 100 mosmol/kg, SG ≤1.003).

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Abnormally conc urine + euvolemic hypoNa = SIADH (whereas ↑ ADH i/s/o hypovolemia = appropriate ↑ in ADH)
  \item
    Urine Na+ (\textless20 = EABV depletion; \textgreater40 = SIADH, cerebral salt wasting, diuretic use, renal failure)
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Management:} address underlying cause (volume if hypovolemic, fluid restriction if eu/hypervolemic), time course to match timing of onset (fast rx for onset \textless12h, slow rx for slow onset to prevent CPM).

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Acute, symptomatic:} ICU admit, 3\% HTS to raise {[}Na+{]} by 3-5 mEq/L (give \textasciitilde TBW x 5 mEq/L x 2).
\item
  \textbf{Chronic, asymptomatic:} calculate Na+ Deficit (mEq) = (140 -- Na+actual) x TBW, where TBW = weight in kg x 0.6 for males, 0.5 for females. Then give IVF to account for missing Na+ content; should not exceed 0.5 mEq/L/hr rise in {[}Na+{]}.
\item
  \textbf{SIADH:} restrict free water intake to match insensible losses + UOP; use vaptans if severe.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{hypernatremia}{%

\textbf{Definition:} Na+ \textgreater{} 145mEq/L

\textbf{Etiology:} \textbf{excessive water loss} (GI losses / Diuretics / Central or nephrogenic DI (see endocrine section) / Osmotic diuresis / Increased insensible losses / Impaired thirst mechanism) vs \textbf{excessive salt provision}

\textbf{Clinical Presentation:} lethargy, irritability, MS changes. Typically presents w/ sx of underlying cause.

\textbf{Exam:} check volume status, neurologic exam, mental status.

\textbf{Workup:} UA, chem 10, urine osm (appropriate response to hyperNa → ↑ ADH → concentrated urine. Inappropriately dilute urine i/s/o hyperNa → think DI), serum osm (Uosm \textless{} Sosm → think DI).

\textbf{Management}

\begin{enumerate}

\item
  Replace ½ of FWD w/in 24h, then remainder over next 1-2 days, and replace maintenance + ongoing losses. Avoid ↓ Na+ by \textgreater15 mEq/L over 24h (0.5 mEq/L/hr) due to risk of cerebral edema.

\section{Hypokalemia}\label{hypokalemia}}

\textbf{PowerPlan:} MSICU Intermittent IV Electrolyte Replacement Orderset

\textbf{Definition:} K+ \textless{} 3.5 mEq/L

\textbf{Etiology:} decreased K+ intake (malnutrition), increased K+ entry into cells (alkalosis → H+ for K+ / insulin / beta adrenergic activity - albuterol, pheo), increased GI losses (diarrhea, vomiting, laxative abuse, copious GT losses), renal losses (diuretics due to loops/thiazides but NOT aldo antagonists, mineralocorticoid excess -- primary hyperaldo, hyperreninemic states {[}p/w HTN, hyperNa, metabolic alkalosis{]}, Type I/II RTA, Gitelman/Bartter)

\textbf{Pathophysiology:} low K+ → hyperpolarization of myocytes → lack of inhibition of voltage-gated Na+ channels → ↑ Na+ entry into myocytes and ↑ excitability → cardiac arrhythmias

\textbf{Clinical Presentation (generally only K+ \textless{} 3):} muscle weakness, fatigue, constipation → ileus, tetany, rhabdo, respiratory muscle failure, EKG changes (ST depression → dec T wave amplitude → U waves)

\hypertarget{hemolytic-uremic-syndrome}{%
\section{Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome}\label{hemolytic-uremic-syndrome}}

\textbf{Definition}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome:} microangiopathic hemolytic anemia + AKI + thrombocytopenia
\item
  \textbf{Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura:} triad of HUS + fever + neurologic changes
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Etiology}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Principally affects children under the age of five years.
\item
  90\% due to shiga toxin; of those 70\% due to \emph{enterohemorrhagic E. Coli}.
\item
  Occurs in 6-9\% of EHEC infections; usually begins 5-10 days after diarrhea onset.
\item
  Non-diarrheal (atypical) HUS associated can be due to S. pneumo infection or due to defects in the complement system (e.g., mutations in complement regulatory proteins).
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Pathophysiology}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{HUS:} Shiga toxin binds to receptors in glomerular, colonic, and cerebral cells → promotes adhesion and aggregation of platelets onto endothelial cells → thrombocytopenia and RBC shearing (microangiopathic anemia); in kidney, glomerular damage.
\item
  \textbf{TTP:} due to deficiency or immune-mediated inhibition of ADAMTS13, a metalloproteinase responsible for breakdown of vWF. No vWF cleavage → coagulation occurs at a higher rate, particularly in microvasculature → platelet consumption → thrombocytopenia and microthrombi → microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Clinical Presentation}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia → jaundice, pallor, dark urine.
\item
  Thrombocytopenia → petechiae, bleeding.
\item
  Acute renal failure → HTN, edema.
\item
  Other systems

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Central nervous system:} seizures, coma, stroke
  \item
    \textbf{Cardiac:} dysfunction due to ischemia, uremia, fluid overload
  \item
    \textbf{Pancreas:} transient DM
  \item
    \textbf{Liver:} hepatomegaly, increased serum transaminases
  \item
    \textbf{Heme:} in addition to anemia and thrombocytopenia, leukocytosis is common in diarrhea-induced HUS; the prognosis is worse with increased white blood cell counts.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Workup}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \textbf{CBC w/diff + retic:} anemia, thrombocytopenia w/ appropriate reticulocytosis.
\item
  \textbf{Smear:} schistocytes
\item
  ↑ LDH, ↓ haptoglobin, Coombs negative (evidence of intravascular hemolysis).
\item
  \textbf{Chem 10:} evidence of acute kidney injury, elevated BUN/Cr
\item
  \textbf{LFTs:} elevation in transaminases, unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia
\item
  \textbf{UA:} possible proteinuria, hematuria.
\item
  Stool culture: causative pathogen
\item
  Head CT if any change in MS or abnormal neurologic exam.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Management}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  Treatment mainly supportive; judicious fluid management (see section on AKI), correct electrolyte abnormalities, transfuse RBCs if needed (avoid platelets unless actively bleeding, as this may worsen the TMA process), manage hypertension.
\item
  If significant CNS involvement or if TTP is suspected, consider plasmapheresis.
\item
  For non-STx mediated (atypical) HUS, consider eculizumab (anti-C5 antibody; prevents activation of terminal complement pathway).
\item
  5-10\% mortality; 5-10\% progress to ESRD. Inc WBC, seizure, or CVA = poor prognostic factors.
\end{itemize}

    Consider BP measurements at school, home, or ambulatory BP monitoring.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Phase 2: Screening Studies}

  \begin{itemize}

\textbf{Management}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  For essential hypertension, can consider dietary/lifestyle modifications as first-line approach for patients with Stage 1 hypertension and no evidence of end-organ damage.
\item
  Pharmacologic therapy typically indicated for patients with Stage 2 hypertension, symptomatic hypertension, evidence of end-organ damage, or Stage 1 hypertension that does not improve after 4-6 months of lifestyle modifications.
\item
  Choice of pharmacologic agent depends on underlying etiology.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    For renin-mediated hypertension (renal artery stenosis, renal scarring), ACE-inhibitor usually best choice (e.g., enalapril 0.08 mg/kg/day).
  \item
    For volume-related hypertension (e.g., glomerulonephritis) use diuretics (e.g., HCTZ 1-3 mg/kg once daily).
  \end{itemize}
\item
  General principle is to choose one medication and increase dose until reach maximum recommended dose, then add an additional agent until hypertension controlled.

\begin{itemize}

\item
  All babies typically lose up to 2-3\% of BW/day, should not lose more than 10-12\% of BW before discharge. Babies born by c-section may lose more weight than vaginal births (Mom and therefore baby get IV fluids during delivery). Usually start gaining on DOL4. Baby should regain BW by 10-14 days and should gain 20-30g/day for first month, or 5 oz per week (``an ounce a day and time off for weekends'').
\item
  Babies usually awake for first 5-6 hrs and then sleepy for 24 hrs. Start waking up on DOL2 and are hungry (``all day cafe''). Sometimes if baby is not getting enough with feeds, may shut down and appear sleepy.
\end{itemize}

\hypertarget{breastfeeding}{%

Newborns who are \textbf{breastfed need to eat every 2-3 hours}, on demand. If showing hunger cues, feed, even if just fed. No such thing as newborn ``using mother as a pacifier.'' Cluster feeding (at breast for several hours) happens on Day 2-3, as baby tries to get milk to come in. Mother may feel tired and frustrated. Reassure that this is NORMAL. Milk usually comes in around 3-5 days.

  \textbf{Infant latch}: Line up baby nose to nipple. Stroke baby lips with nipple. Aim nipple to roof of baby's mouth. Support baby's neck at the shoulders so head tips back and \textbf{bring baby onto breast (\emph{not} breast to baby).}
  \textgreater\textgreater{} - Signs of a good latch: lips flanged outward, \textbf{most of areola hidden} in mouth, nose free
\item
  Breast milk can sit out 8 hrs if freshly pumped, or 5 days in refrigerator. Can store 6-12 mos in freezer. Don't refreeze thawed breastmilk.
\item
  Mothers can hand express and/or pump to stimulate milk production. Holding baby skin to skin also stimulates because of hormone release. Hand expression is helpful especially for colostrum or if engorged. Can feed to baby via spoon or syringe.
\item
  For determining if mom's meds are safe during breastfeeding: \textbf{LactMed} (part of NIH ToxNet), \textbf{Hale's Medications \& Mother's Milk} (physical book in BMC workroom or HalesMeds.com. Physical book in BWH nursery)

  Purines are metabolized to hypoxanthine and xanthine, and then to uric acid via xanthine oxidase. Uric acid is poorly soluble in water leading to crystal precipitation and deposition in the renal tubules and AKI.
\item
  \textbf{Allopurinol} competitively inhibits xanthine oxidase, blocking the metabolism of hypoxanthine and xanthine to uric acid. Xanthine is less soluble than uric acid so allopurinol can exacerbate AKI.
\item
  Cancer cells have \textasciitilde4X higher Phos than normal cells. Hyperphosphatemia can lead to secondary hypocalcemia and renal calcium phosphate precipitation. Hypocalcemia may also cause cardiac arrhythmias.

  \textbf{Intrathecal catheter:} The catheter sits beyond the pia mater, inside the same area as the spinal cord. Typically only used for end-of-life pain, often will cause a dense motor block. Narrow therapeutic index.
\item
  \textbf{Epidural catheter:} The catheter sits in the epidural space right above the dura mater. Used for post-operative pain (lumbar epidural for lower abdominal or pelvic procedures, thoracic epidural for thoracic or large abdominal procedures), as well as for cancer pain. Often able to achieve a strictly sensory block, though motor block common w/ lumbar epidurals.

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Checking a level w/ ice will show you the earliest onset of a block, as temperature is blocked before pain.
  \end{itemize}
\item
  \textbf{Pinprick:} Using cocktail sword, blunt needle, or twisted up alcohol wipe wrapper, poke areas of different dermatomes below the level of the suspected block. Ask for any difference in sensation to a poke above the level of the block or on an arm.

\item
  Reassure families that their child will not become a ``drug addict'' on the appropriate opioid regimen. Educate them on the difference between addiction and dependence
\item
  Increase opioid dose based on clinical response; the ``right dose'' is the dose that best controls pain with the fewest side effects.

\item
  30\% increase for mild pain
\item

\item
  Many families believe CPR WILL restore their child to their baseline. It is helpful to describe it as an ATTEMPT to reverse death. Use of the word ``die'' also helps to clarify this.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{\emph{Talking About the Role of LST: Sample Language}}
\emph{We all share the hope that your child will live as long as possible. But that is usually not the only goal. We also want your child to live as well as he possibly can, and some of the treatments that we use to extend life may alter his quality of life in ways that may not be what you would wish for him. If the time comes when critical decisions need to be made, you will have more control over the situation if we all understand and agree about what is most important for you and your child. Talking about these possibilities does not mean that we are giving up -- we think of this strategy as hoping for the best, but planning for the worst. In case your child does not get better, what are you hoping for?}

\textbf{Milestones from Bright Futures and CDC}

Early Intervention is responsible for assessing developmental delays and providing appropriate support in children birth through 2 years and 9 months. The Public School System is responsible for assessing deficits and providing appropriate support after 2.9 years. Their initial assessment is called a ``TEAM evaluation''. An Individualized Education Plan (IEP) is developed after the TEAM evaluation.

- Utox, urine HCG
- EKG (document baseline QTc)

-- Behavioral plan
- Supervision: 1:1 sitter vs.~security, safety tray, safety check prior to any room changes
- Activity level: Start w/ confined to room (Psych will decide when out-of-room privileges are ok, e.g.~supervised walks around unit or visit to playroom at RN's discretion
- Electronics: Start w/ no phone or internet (Psych will decide if/when permitted and w/ what level of supervision/restrictions)

-- Agitation plan, per Psychiatry on {[}date{]}
- Mild agitation: Utilize behavioral strategies
- Moderate agitation: Ativan OR Haldol , ALWAYS WITH Benadryl . Call BRT to help prevent further escalation to severe agitation.
- Severe agitation: Olanzapine PO/IM (Zydis ODT for PO) OR Haldol PO/IM , ALWAYS WITH Benadryl PO/IM PRN. Call 5-5555 to activate Behavioral Rapid Response (summons Psych, BRT, Security). Call on-call Psych if requires IM or if not responding within 20-30min or if need further guidance.
- If administering antipsychotics, daily EKG to monitor QTc (target \textless{} 450)

\subsubsection{Ways to respond}\label{ways-to-respond}}

Recognize and respond to initial signs of agitation or inappropriate behavior w/ redirection. Avoid using the word ``no.''
Avoid non-specific comments such as ``behave'' or ``calm down''

Ignore behavior that is disruptive, but not harmful. Make a blank non-smiling face, avoid eye contact and turn away. As soon as the child stops the unwanted behavior, smile and make eye contact.
Give the child a space - somewhere calm and safe - where they can go when they feel overwhelmed.
Do not simply react; try to understand the reasons behind the behavior.

\hypertarget{managing-the-situation}{%

Managing the situation
Start by asking ``what do you want?''
Try the SAVE mnemonic: Support ''Let's work together\ldots'', Acknowledge ``I see this has been hard for you.'', Validate ''I'd probably be reacting the same way if I was in your shoes.'', Emotion naming ''You seem upset.'' or similar communication efforts when talking with the patient.

Strategies will differ based on degree of agitation:

\textbf{Mild}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist

  Listen, validate, problem-solve
\item
  Stay w/ the patient, have them sit w/ you

According to TADS and CAMS (2 large RCTs w/ govt oversight), combination therapy of SSRI + CBT is superior to monotherapy w/ either! CBT or SSRI is superior to placebo.
No SSRI-associated suicidal events in either study, but when initiating SSRI it is important to monitor carefully (wks 1-4: weekly; wks 5-12: every other week) for any signs of ↑ suicidality
- \textbf{NEVER} prescribe paroxetine (Paxil) to adolescents (black box warning for suicide)

\textbf{SSRIs are 1st line}: Help ⅔ of pts in first trial over \textbf{4-8 wks}. ⅔ of nonresponders respond to 2nd trial.
- \textbf{Sertraline (Zoloft)} and \textbf{Fluoxetine (Prozac)} are most commonly used, least SE (used in TADS, CAMS).

\section{Autoinflammatory Diseases}\label{autoinflammatory-diseases}}

\textbf{Autoimmune vs.~Autoinflammatory}

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  In broad strokes, autoinflammatory conditions are thought to be due to disruptions in innate immunity, whereas autoimmune conditions are due to disruptions in immune tolerance/adaptive immunity
\item
  Autoinflammatory conditions often have mutations in genes related to the inflammatory cascade leading to uncontrolled inflammation with high levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, fevers + rashes, and a similar incidence in males and females; biologics that block IL-1 and IL-6 can be helpful
\item
  Autoimmune conditions may have auto-antigens and auto-reactive T-cells and B-cells; fever is not a core feature, although may be present; usually F\textgreater M; drugs that inhibit T-cells and B-cells are more useful (e.g.~calcineurin inhibitors, MTX, rituximab)
\item
  These divisions are not black and white, and most diseases are thought to lie on the spectrum and/or develop in immune pathophysiology over time (see sJIA)
\end{itemize}
