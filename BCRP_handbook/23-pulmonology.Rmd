# Pulmonology 

## Asthma – ED/Inpatient: EBG
### History to Elicit
Time of onset, causes/triggers, symptom severity, prior treatments before presentation, last time of medications, last dose of oral steroids and past requirements for oral steroid doses

### Exam
- Tachypnea, hypoxia, altered mental status, accessory muscle use, URI symptoms, wheezing, prolonged expiratory phase, eczema, rash, signs of pneumonia/pneumothorax
- **Red flags**: dehydration, cyanosis/pallor, decreased aeration, AMS, admission w/i  1 year, ICU admission within 3 years, PCP/ED visit w/i 72 hours

### Etiology
Trigger → Production of IgE antibodies, overstimulation of mast cells/eosinophils → Inflammation, airway smooth muscle constriction, mucus production, edema → hyper-responsiveness of airway, obstruction, air-trapping → airway remodeling

### Work-up
* Assess severity w/ amount of dyspnea, RR, retractions, inspiratory vs. expiratory wheezes, and SpO2 (determines the HASS score).
* Not routinely recommended: CXR (unless prolonged fever, asymmetry post-albuterol, severe symptoms, hypoxemia, aspiration concern), viral testing, blood gas (if respiratory failure is suspected)

### Order Sets
“Asthma admit plan” (includes albuterol, Unineb, etc orders)

### Treatment

## Hemoptysis (CF)
### Definition
Acute bleeding >240 cc in 24 hours or recurrent bleeding of >100 cc daily for several days

### Management
* Call for help
* Assess site of bleeding on auscultation and place patient with that side down 
* Interventions: attempt to identify bleeding source, hemostasis interventions, chest CT, bronchial artery embolization, tranexamic acid, ECMO
* ORL and GI consult to help evaluate for hematemesis vs. hemoptysis
* Treatment is all guided by the volume of hemoptysis
     * **Scant**: anything from blood-streaked mucous to a teaspoon (5 mL)
          * Consider stopping NSAIDS, but guidelines recommend continuing the rest of the pulmonary clearance regimen!
          * Ensure vitamin K replete
     * **Mild/moderate**: approximately between an ounce and half a cup
          * Here’s where you might consider decreasing pulmonary clearance regimen, weighing the risks of bleeding with the need to remove the inspissated mucous causing the problem
          * Hypertonic saline is more caustic/irritating than dornase alfa
          *  If your patient is bleeding so much that you’re considering holding their BIPAP to avoid destabilizing a clot, they should be in a higher level of care
          *  Consider tranexamic acid (inhaled or IV) to stabilize clot
          *  Bronchoalveolar embolization of the bleeding arteries by interventional radiology is the gold standard treatment
    * **Massive**: more than a cup
          * Bleeding lung down to the bed to maximize gas exchange in the other lung
          * ICU stat or code blue

## Pulmonary Function Tests

* Indications:<br>

     1. Determine the nature of an unknown disease process
     2.  Study progression of  known disease (asthma, CF)
     3. Evaluate effect of therapy
     4. Establish a baseline in pts whose lung function is affected by a disease 

* Difficult to reliably obtain in children <6
* Reference values depend on age, height, gender, race

### Definitions
#### Forced vital capacity (FVC)

Measures total amount of air you can exhale w/ force after you inhale as deeply as possible

#### Forced expiratory volume 1 (FEV1)
Measures the amount of air you can exhale w/ force in one breath. The amount of air you exhale measured at 1 second

#### Forced expiratory flow 25% to 75%
This measures the air flow over the middle half of the FVC

#### Peak expiratory flow (PEF):
The maximum flow rate obtained during a forced exhalation. It is usually measured at the same time as your forced vital capacity (FVC)

#### Total lung capacity (TLC)
This measures the total volume of air in your lungs after you inhale as deeply as possible

#### Functional residual capacity (FRC)
This measures the amount of air in your lungs at the end of a normal exhaled breath

#### Expiratory reserve volume (ERV)
This measures the difference between the amount of air in your lungs after a normal exhale (FRC) and the amount after you exhale w/ force (RV)

## Obstructive vs. Restrictive Lung Disease
||Obstructive|Restrictive|
|---|---|---|
|**Definition**|The airways are narrowed, usually causing an increase in the time it takes to empty the lungs. <br>Affect flow.|Either a loss of lung tissue, a decrease in the lungs' ability to expand, or a decrease in the lungs' ability to transfer oxygen to the blood. <br> Affect volume.|
|**FVC**| Decreased|Decreased|
|**FEV1**|Decreased|Decreased|
|**FEV1/FVC**|Decreased|Normal or increased|
|**TLC**|Normal|Decreased|
|**Differential Diagnosis**|Asthma, bronchiectasis, bronchiolitis obliterans, cystic fibrosis, alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency|Chest wall: ankylosing spondylitis, kyphosis, obesity, scoliosis<br>Drugs: amiodarone, methotrexate, nitrofurantoin<br>Interstitial lung disease: pneumonia, hypersensitivity pneumonitis, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, sarcoidosis, exposures (asbestos, beryllium) <br>Neuromuscular disorders: Guillain-Barre syndrome, muscular dystrophy, myasthenia gravis|
|**Extent of Defect**|% of predicted FEV1: Normal >80%, Mild ~80%, Moderate 60-80%, Severe  <60% <br>FEF 25-75: Decreased|% of predicted TLC: Normal >80%, Mild 70-80%, Moderate 60-70%, Severe <60%|
|**Pattern**|![](./images/pulm_obstructive.jpg)|![](./images/pulm_restrictive.jpg)|

## Bronchodilator/Bronchoprovocation Testing in Asthma
* Response to bronchodilator: significant if FEV1 improved by >12-15% 
* Exercise challenge: 12-15% decrease in FEV1 is indicative of airway responsiveness
* Cold air challenge: 12-15% decrease in FEV1 is indicative of airway responsiveness
