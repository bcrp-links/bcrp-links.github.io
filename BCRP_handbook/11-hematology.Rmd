## Anemia [^1]

### Definition
Anemia is a reduction in hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit. The lower/upper limit of the normal range is set at two standard deviations below the mean for age and sex for the general population.

**Normal Mean and Lower Limits of Normal for Hgb, Hct & MCV**

## Sickle Cell Anemia {#scd}

#### Pathophysiology
Autosomal recessive missense mutation (Glu → Val) at position 6 of B-globin gene

#### Clinical manifestations
- **Vaso-occlusive (pain) crisis:** Ischemia → pain
	- *Triggers:* Cold weather (vasospasm), hypoxia, infection, dehydration, acidosis, alcohol intoxication, emotional stress, pregnancy, exertional stress
	- **Bones:** Most commonly long bones like femur, tibia, humerus, and lumbar vertebrae (femoral head → avascular necrosis)
	- **Joints & soft tissue:** Dactylitis or hand and foot syndrome - painful and swollen hands/feet
	- **Abdomen:** Can mimic an acute abdomen
	- **Renal:** Papillary necrosis → hyposthenuria (inability to concentrate urine)
	- **Lungs:** Acute chest syndrome
	- **CNS:** Cerebral infarction, hemorrhage (young adults), seizures, transient ischemic attacks, cranial nerve palsies, meningitis, sensory deficits, and acute coma
	- **Skin:** Ulceration, especially over bony prominences (malleoli)
	- **Eye:** Retinal hemorrhages, proliferative retinopathy (more common in HbSC)
	- **Penis:** Prevents drainage of blood from the corpus cavernosum leading to priapism
- **Acute chest syndrome (ACS):** Pulmonary infarction → fever, cough, chest pain, SOB, new pulmonary infiltrate on x-ray
- **Fever:** Viral vs. bacterial (including encapsulated organisms: H. flu, S. pneumoniae, N. meningitidis)
	- Children w/ sickle cell anemia also have lower serum IgM levels, impaired opsonization, and sluggish alternative complement pathway activation, so are susceptible to Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Salmonella, Staphylococcus aureus, and Escherichia coli
- **Sepsis:** Strep pneumo is most common cause 
- **Hyposplenia:** Splenic autoinfarction → susceptible to infections w/ encapsulated bacteria
- **Osteomyelitis:** Staph > Salmonella, treat w/ CTX/Vanc
- **Aplastic crisis:** Decreased retic/RBCs, parvo B19 infection, pallor, weakness, fatigue
- **Splenic sequestration crisis:** Marked decrease in hemoglobin level despite persistent reticulocytosis, splenic vasoocclusion → rapid splenomegaly, prior to autosplenectomy

#### Diagnosis
- **VOE:**
	- **Labs:** CBCd (compare to baseline Hb), retics, chem10, LFTs, amylase/lipase, T&S
	- **Imaging:** CXR PA & lateral for fever, chest wall pain, hypoxia, or respiratory symptoms
- **Fever:**
	- **Labs:** CBCd (compare to baseline Hb), retics, chem10, LFTs, amylase/lipase, T&S, BCx (for 1st temp >38.5C or 101.3F) and qdaily w/ temp spikes, ABG if hypoxic
	- **Other studies:** UA/UCx (cath all M <6mo, F <2yo, or any child w/ urinary sx), viral panel, throat culture (if suggestive on exam), stool studies (if having diarrhea), LP (if neurologic s/sx)
	- **Imaging:** CXR PA & lateral (if fever, chest wall pain, hypoxia, respiratory symptoms)

#### Management
See sections below on **VOE, ACS,** and **fever**

### Vaso-Occlusive Episode (VOE)
***_BMC Sickle Cell Cards:_*** NOTE practices may vary at BCH. Should not replace clinical judgment or Pedi Heme consult (place consult order in EPIC and page on-call pager 5731); please page daily after rounds to discuss management as needed, and read daily consult note for detailed recommendations.

![](./images/heme_bmcvoecard_1.png)
![](./images/heme_bmcvoecard_2.png)

***_THE INFORMATION BELOW IS APPLICABLE TO BOTH BMC & BCH:_***

#### Fluids, Monitoring, & Labs
- Hydration: D5 1/2NS or D5 NS @ 1.25x maintenance is crucial to lessen sickling
- Continuous pulse oximetry
- Routine labs are not needed for uncomplicated VOE
- DVT prophylaxis should be addressed for all patients per inpatient protocol

##### Pain Management
- **Non-opioid analgesics:**
	- Standing NSAID: **Ketorolac** on admission if proven benefit; after 72 hrs switch to standing ibuprofen q6h
	- Additional modalities: **Ketamine** (refer to Lexicomp for dosage), hot packs, lidocaine patch, distraction, Child Life, relaxation, acupuncture
- **Opioids:**
	- Management and prevention of opioid **side effects:**
		- **Constipation:** Standing stimulant laxative (senna) and daily Miralax w/ admit. Titrate for 1 soft formed stool q1-2d. Escalate PRN, may add Mg citrate, milk of magnnesia, lactulose, methylnaltrexone.
		- **Pruritus and nausea:** Start w/ camphor-menthol lotion for mild itching. Next step is a naloxone drip at 0.5 mcg/kg/h, titrate up to 2 mcg/kg/h q3-4h for significant itching/nausea. Can then add Zofran. Avoid Benadryl given the sedating effect.
		- **Prevent hypoventilation:** Crucially important in preventing atelectasis and ACS! Incentive spirometer 10x/hr while awake and q4h overnight. Bubbles or pinwheel in younger kids. HOB elevated to 30 degrees at all times. Have patient sit up in bed, out of bed to chair, and ambulation as tolerated. Standing albuterol q4-6h for pt w/ asthma, history of wheeze w/ prior VOE, chest or back pain, or any current wheezing or cough. Oxygen overnight PRN (goal O2 sat > 95% or pt’s known baseline; can provide NC O2 at 0.5-1L for mild desats while asleep; does not replace the need for incentive spirometry). Continue any home respiratory therapies (home O2, CPAP, etc).
	- **Titration of PCA/opioids:**
		- Use patient reported pain score (compare to baseline/chronic pain level) AND change in pain AND patient functional status to assess pain control
		- Assess for VOE vs. opioid side effects to help w/ dose adjustment
		- Reassess pain control frequently, especially during first 24 hrs, and adjust PCA as needed w/ goal of providing 2/3 of total opioid dose as basal and 1/3 as demand
		- Consider increasing basal rate by 20% overnight early in the admission to avoid falling behind in pain control while asleep
		- As pain is captured, wean PCA rate and then switch to orals
	- **Weaning to orals:** Please discuss patient specific plan w/ Pedi Heme; details will depend on length of admission, pain tolerance, and patient preference. In general, when pain is well-controlled, replace the basal PCA w/ SCHEDULED long- or short-acting oral medication (MS Contin, oxycodone, or hydromorphone), leaving the PCA demand button. If pain remains well-controlled after 12-24 hrs, then replace PCA demand w/ a standing short-acting medication (often oxycodone, tramadol, or hydromorphone). This step should be considered both a conversion and a wean.
		- **Quick conversion from IV to oral opiates** (meant as a guide, not a mandate):

| Total Basal IV morphine use over 24 hours | Total Basal IV dilaudid use over 24 hours | MSContin dose | If using ONLY oxycodone |
|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|---------------|-------------------------|
| 10mg                                      | 2.5mg                                     | 15mg PO q12   | 5mg PO q6               |
| 15mg                                      | 4mg                                       | 15mg PO q8    | 5mg PO q4               |
| 20mg                                      | 5mg                                       | 30mg PO q12   | 10mg PO q6              |
| 30mg                                      | 8mg                                       | 30mg PO q8    | 10mg PO q4              |

#### Discharge planning
- Ready for discharge when pain is controlled on oral meds (pain may not be gone at this time)
- Continue standing pain meds x48hrs at home before tapering to PRN
- Anticipate home opioid needs; ask if opioids are available at home, and prescribe meds-in-hand early on day of discharge. If patient prefers to fill meds at home pharmacy, provide Rx early in hospital course (controlled substance prescriptions can now be faxed or sent electronically). Be aware of specific MA prescribing requirements for opioids.
- Schedule follow-up in Heme clinic w/i 1 week (BMC clinic phone # 617-414-4841), appointments are available everyday Mon-Fri

### Acute Chest Syndrome (ACS)
ACS in SCD is multifactorial. Causes include **infection, bronchospasm, inflammation,** and **fat embolization.** It can be very serious and needs to be managed very closely.

#### Optimize ventilation
to prevent serious sequelae from ACS:

- Incentive spirometry 10x per hour while awake and q4h overnight
- Have patient sitting up in bed, out of bed to chair, and ambulation as tolerated
- Examine patients for any drop in O2 saturation — do NOT simply put on oxygen w/o evaluating
- Standing albuterol neb q4-6h for those patients with known benefit, people with a history of reactive airway, asthma, wheeze on clinical exam. Add inhaled corticosteroid only if on one at home
- Consult Pulm for any patient w/ wheezing, severe ACS, or as needed to help optimize respiratory status; please notify Pulm when of their patients are admitted w/ ACS
- Consider high flow NC or BIPAP as appropriate (requires ICU transfer)

#### Fluid balance
needs to be monitored carefully:

- Patients w/ SCD require increased IVF in cases of VOE or fever/dehydration. However, overhydration can worsen ACS.
- In general, use IV + PO at 1x maintenance for patients w/ ACS
- Must have strict I/O’s ordered and reviewed regularly to adjust fluids as needed

#### Other monitoring & labs
- Continuous pulse oximetry
- All patients w/ ACS should have an active **type & screen**
- **DVT prophylaxis** should be addressed for all patients per inpatient protocol

#### Antibiotics
should include coverage for pneumococcus and atypicals (typically ceftriaxone and oral azithromycin):

- See Fever guidelines below for details

#### Transfusions
must be approved by Heme:

- Need to balance need for immediate treatment w/ long term risks of alloimmunization
- If the patient does not have an O2 requirement, we typically attempt medical management w/ abx and aggressive pulmonary toilet for 24hrs before transfusing
- Potential indications for transfusion in ACS include a drop in Hb > 2g/dL below baseline w/o appropriate reticulocytosis, a significant oxygen requirement, or worsening work of breathing
- See Blood Transfusions section below for details

#### Discharge planning
- Stable for discharge when BCx are negative x48hrs and respiratory status is stable/improved
- Should complete a full course of antibiotics to cover both pneumococcus and atypicals
- Schedule follow-up w/ PCP w/o the week and in Heme clinic preferably w/i a week (BMC clinic phone # 617-414-4841), appts at BMC are available every day Mon-Fri
- At BMC, please refer to Pulm for outpatient follow-up (referral for “SCD w/ ACS”)

### Fever

#### Definition
T >38.5C (101.3F) if >2mo

#### Work-up
- Detailed history and physical exam to identify potential source
- **Labs:** CBCd (compare to baseline Hb), retics, chem10, clot (hold for Blood Bank), BCx (for 1st temp >38.5C (101.3F) and qdaily w/ temp spikes), ABG (if hypoxic)
- **Other studies:** UA/UCx (cath all M <6mo, F <2yo, or any child w/ urinary sx), viral panel, throat culture (if suggestive on exam), stool studies (if having diarrhea), LP (if neurologic s/sx)
- **Imaging:** CXR PA & lateral (if fever, chest wall pain, hypoxia, respiratory symptoms)

#### Management
- **Inpatient** management:
	- IV bolus of 10 - 20 ml/kg if dehydrated→ IV fluids @ 1.25 Maint (+/- for fluid intolerance vs. dehydration)
	- **Antibiotics:** Goal administration w/i 30 min of arrival! Draw cultures first. Do not delay treatment while awaiting lab results and CXR. Needs empiric antibiotics even if a source of infection is identified.
		- **Ceftriaxone** 50 mg/kg IV/IM q24h (max dose 1g/day), q12h (max 2g/day) if suspect meningitis. If allergic to Ceftriaxone, consider Levofloxacin or Clindamycin if inpatient.
		- Add **Vancomycin** 40-60 mg/kg/day divided q6h for CNS involvement (including meningitis), septic shock, central line/port, or hx of resistant infection
		- For HD instability or meningitis; consider in pts w/ port or hx of resistant infection
		- Add **Azithromycin** PO for pts w/ positive CXR or respiratory symptoms
- **Outpatient** management and follow-up:
	- Observe in ED for 2 hrs after giving CTX. **Return if:** Temp >38.5C; poor PO intake; lethargy; respiratory symptoms; pain.
	- Follow up in Hematology clinic, PCP’s office, or ED in 24 hours for re-evaluation & 2nd dose of CTX
	- Follow up BCx at 24 and 48 hrs → call PCP regarding ED visit & to assure follow up

### Blood Transfusions in SCD
Blood transfusions in SCD are used to increase RBC mass and oxygen carrying capacity and to decrease proportion of sickle cells. Acute benefits of transfusion must be weighed against the long-term risks, including alloimmunization. Phenotypically matched (ABO, Rh-D, Kell, C, E), sickle negative, leuko-depleted irradiated packed red blood cells are the blood product of choice. More extensive phenotyping needed for patients on chronic transfusion. It may take hours for the blood bank to find matched blood, and even longer in cases of alloimmunization so maintain an active type and screen if you anticipate needing to transfuse a patient.

#### Potential indications for transfusion
- Aplastic crisis/acute anemia (drop in Hb > 2g/dL below baseline) w/o an appropriate reticulocytosis
- Acute chest syndrome (ACS) not responsive to medical management or severe disease/ hypoxemia
- Symptomatic anemia
- Pre-procedure prophylaxis (goal Hb of 10 g/dL)
- Splenic sequestration:
- Hb drop > 2g/dl, drop in platelet count and WBC as well
- Monitor spleen size and labs frequently

#### Amount of blood to transfuse
based on goal Hb:

- mL of pRBC = (desired Hb - current Hb) x (wt (kg) x Blood Vol(ml/kg)) /(Hb of PRBC)
- Blood volume = 80mL/kg for children
- Hb of pRBCs = 18.5g/dL at BMC, avg HCT 60% at BCH
- 1 unit pRBC = 250-350 mL; consider rounding down to a whole unit to avoid extra donor exposure

#### Other considerations
- Premedicate only if history of transfusion reaction
- Need for post-transfusions labs to be dictated by individual case


## Transfusion Medicine

### Consenting a Patient for Blood Products

#### Risks
- Fever, chills, hives/itching, and shortness of breath (can be managed w/ medications)
- Hemolytic transfusion reaction or transfusion-related lung injury (rare)
- Bacterial or viral infection (hepatitis C, hepatitis B, HIV, malaria). Blood is extensively screened to prevent this.

#### Benefits
Improve blood clotting or oxygen delivery

#### Alternatives (may not work as quickly)
- Colony stimulating factor
- Vitamin K
- No treatment (note: parents may not refuse blood products in life-threatening situations)
