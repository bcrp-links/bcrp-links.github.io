## Neonatal Respiratory Disorders & Delivery Room Pathology

- Can be divided into:
	- Upper airway blockage (choanal atresia, pharyngeal airway malformation)
	- Impaired lung function

### Choanal Atresia

#### History
Pink when crying, cyanotic when quiet. Inability to pass NG tube in one or both sides

#### Management
Oral airway, intubation

### Pharyngeal Airway Malformation

#### History
Persistent Retractions, poor aeration

#### Management
Prone positioning, posterior nasopharyngeal tube

### Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia (CDH)

#### History
Assymetric lung sounds, cyanosis with bradycardia, scaphoid abdomen. 

#### Diagnosis
Most likely on prenatal imaging in patients with prenatal care. Postnatally diagnosed with CXR

#### Management
Intubation, **avoid positive pressure**! Place orogastric tube. 

### Pleural Effusion

#### History
Diminished aeration with poor osygenation/ventilation

#### Management
Intubation, needle thoracentesis +/- chest tube. Volume expansion if hemodynamically unstable. Fluid analysis to determine type and source of fluid. 

### Pneumothorax

#### History
Persistent cyanosis, hypoxemia, +/- bradycardia associated with respiratory distress

#### Diagnosis
CXR 

#### Management
Needle thoracentesis immediately, chest tube if recurrent 

### Meconium Aspiration

#### History
Meconium stained fluid, respiratory distress and/or apnea if severe

#### Diagnosis
CXR

#### Management
Can deep suction upper airway. Tracheal suctioning not recommended. Intubation per NRP 

#### Complications
Can cause lung inflamation and direct surfactant inactivation and one of the causes of persistnet pulmonary hypertension, there is a range of severity but can be quite severe! 

### Persistent Pulmonay Hypertension (PPHN)

#### History
Asphyxia, mecoumium aspiration, intrinsic lung disease

#### Clinical Manifestations
Hypoxemia, hypotension

#### Diagnostics
CXR with decreased pulmonary vasculature. ECHO with increased R->L shunting. 

#### Management
- Ultimate goal is to decrease the pulmonary vascular resistance and increase pulmonary blood flow. 
- Oxygenation Index (OI): Helpful numeric index evaluating oxygenation to direct management decisions
	- **OI = FiO2 x MAP / PaO2**

### Respiratory Distress Syndrome (RDS)

#### Etiology
Surfactant deficiency, common in premature infants

#### Symtpoms
Hypoxia with respiratory distress 

#### Diagnostics
CXR with ground glass opacities, low lung volumes, air bronchograms 

#### Management
- CPAP or if severe respiratory distress/apnea intubation 
- Surfactant administration if intubated. Can give 2 doses if still intubated 12 hrs after the 1st dose
- Minimize barotrauma and FiO2 

### Transient Tachypnea of the Newborn (TTN)

#### Etiology
Delayed retention of amniotic fluid

#### History
Typically a term infant, higher risk with birth by C-section. 

#### Clinical Manifestations
Tachypnea, respiratory distress, +/- hypoxemia 

#### Diagnosis
CXR with prominent vasculature and fluid in the fissures

#### Management
Supportive care, usually improves in 4-6 hrs. If O2 needs or symptoms last longer than 24 hrs, question diagnosis.


## Neonatal Cardiology	
**NOTE:** See [Cardiology chapter](#cardiology) for full details.

### Blood Pressure for Premature Infants 
- Can be controversial as there are no normatives in the literature, but rough rule of thumb:
	- First 1-2 DOL, MAP = GA (i.e. 24wk infant â†’ goal MAP >24) 
		- Some evidence that MAP should be > 30 mmHG even for ELBW
	- After first few DOL, goal MAP = GA + 5
	- For infants w/ **PPHN**, goal MAP should be based on pulmonary blood flow and urine output, even if it requires higher MAPs than typical for GA (sometimes 40-50 mm Hg)
- Key is to monitor **urine output, pulses, perfusion, trends in BUN/Cr**
	
### Patent Ductus Arteriosus (PDA)

#### Etiology
Failure of ductal tissue to close in the premature infant. Affects about 60% of infants <28 weeks.

#### Clinical Manifestations
- Continuous machine-like murmur
- Hypotension, widened pulse pressure, hyperactive precorium
- Worsening oxygenation and ventilation, secondary to pulmonary over-circulation
- Metabolic acidosis

#### Diagnosis
Echocardiogram 

#### Management
- **Medical therapy:** Indomethacin or ibuprofen or tylenol 
	- Generally contraindicated if large IVH, severe oliguria, or NEC
- **Surgical ligation**
- **Watch & wait:** w/ symptomatic support (i.e. ventilator management, pressors for MAP support)


## Neonatal Hematology

### Anemia

#### Definition
Depends on gestation and chronologic age
 
#### Differential
- **Iatrogenic:** Frequent blood draws, surgical/procedural blood loss
- **Hemorrhagic:** Placental abruption, umblical cord disruption at delivery, head trauma (subcaleal, cephalohematoma), NEC, twin-twin transfusion, IVH
- **Hemolytic:** Rh incompatability, ABO incompatability

#### Work-up
- CBC, retic, type and Coombs, smear, bilirubin, HUS or head imaging if risk for IVH
- At birth: Delivery history, PE,  Kleinhauer-Betke on mother (determines if fetal blood is in maternal circulation) in addition to above

#### Management
- **NOTE:** Transfusion criteria for term and premature infants does not have robust data and is controversial. It tends to be ***facility dependent.***
- **Preterm:**
	* If intubated and acutely ill, Hct 35-40 
	* If "feeding and growing," Hct >30 w/ good reticulocyte 
- **Term:** 
	* If acultely ill, consider transfusing to goal Hct >40 
	* If hemodynamically stable, goal Hct >25 

### Polycythemia

#### Definition
Hct >65

#### Differential
Increased fetal production, placental insufficiency, thyrotoxicosis, gestational diabetes (GDM), genetic disorders (e.g. Trisomy 21, Beckwith-Wiedemann), hypertransfusion, delayed cord clamping, twin-twin transfusion

#### Work-up
- CBC, monitor for hypoglycemia, follow bili & electrolytes
- Monitor especially if there are neurologic symptoms or respiratory distress

#### Management
Partial exchange transfusion w/ normal saline, ideally w/ UVC

- **Indications:** Hct >65 w/ symptoms, >70 and asymptomatic

### Thrombocytopenia

#### Definition
Plt <150 

#### Differential
- **Increased destruction/consumption:** Autoimmune, alloimmune (NAIT), infection/DIC/NEC, drug-induced/toxicity, hypersplenism, Kasabach-Merrit Syndrome, following transfusion
- **Decreased production:** Thrombocytopenia-absent radius, Fanconi anemia, Trisomy 13, 18, 21
- **Miscellaneous:** Asphyxia, pre-eclampsia, Type 2B Von-Willebrand

#### Work-up
- **Labs:** Repeat platelet count, coagulation studies
- **Imaging:** Consider HUS
- Exam for evidence of bleeding
- Maternal history including maternal platelet count

#### Management
Depends on etiology, symptoms, and upcoming needs (i.e. procedures)

- **Platelet goals:**

|GA      |Symptomatic|Asymptomatic|
|--------|-----------|------------|
|Term    | >50-100k  | >20-30k    |
|Pre-Term| >100k     | >50k       |


* Management specific to **Neonatal Alloimmune Thrombocytopenia (NAIT):**
	* Goal plts >20-30k if no active bleeding (use antigen negative platelets to transfuse)
	* Check HUS 
	* Consider steroids or IVIG 
	* Maternal platelet typing

- Infants **_>_ 35 wks GA:** Use [BiliTool](http://bilitool.org/)
- **Premature infants** have light level (LL) and exchange transfusion levels based on gestational age (use corrected GA):

|Gestational Age (corrected)|Phototherapy at TsB|Exchange Transfusion at TsB|
|--------------------|---------------|---------------|
| <28w 0/7           |       5       |       11      |

### Neonatal Entercolitis (NEC)

#### Etiology
- Precise etiology unclear
- Affects 10% of premature infants, w/ increased incidence at lower gestational age
- **Risk factors:** Prematurity, IUGR, preinatal asphyxia, PDA, shock/hypotension, umbilical arterial catheter (UAC), congenital heart disease

#### Clinical Manifestations 
- Abdominal distension/discoloration/redness, feeding intolerance, heme positive stools (may be grossly bloody)
- **Non-specific systemic symptoms,** including: lethargy, apnea, temperature instability, unexplained acidosis, hyperglycemia, poor perfusion
* **Lab abnormalities:** Hyponatremia, hyperkalemia, metabolic acidosis, leukocytosis or leukopenia, thrombocytopenia

#### Management
- Supportive care
- Place replogle tube for decompression
- Antibiotics, start IVF/TPN
- Monitor labs and KUB serially
- Surgery consult

### Malrotation (+/- Mid Gut Volvulus)

#### Etiology
- Developing bowel fails to undergo usual counterclockwise rotation during 4th-10th wk of embryogenesis
- Peritoneal bands that usually attach bowel to central body axis are misplaced and compress duodenum, resulting in partial obstruction
- Volvulus results in intestinal obstruction
- Superior mesenteric artery may be compressed leading to ischemia

#### Clinical Manifestations 
- Newborn <1mo w/ bilious emesis
- Associated w/ diaphragmatic hernia, omphalocele, gastroschisis 

#### Work-up
- **KUB:** Usually unremarkable, may have signs of small bowel obstruction
- **UGI:** Abnormal position of duodenal-jejunal junction. Volvulus appears as spirla corkscrew of duodenum.
- **US:** May show volvulus in small bowel

#### Management
Emergent surgical intervention

- **Modified Ladd's Procedure:**
	- Division of peritoneal bands around the duodenum
	- Colon placed on the left w/ duodenum on the right, to broaden the mesentery 
	- Appendectomy preformed so no confusion w/ future abd pain

### Duodenal Atresia 

#### Etiology
Embryogenic. 1 in 5,000 live births. 25% have Trisomy 21.

#### Clinical Manifestations 
Bilious vomiting hours after birth w/o abdominal distention
